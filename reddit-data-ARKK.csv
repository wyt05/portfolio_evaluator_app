1. I am familiar with the stock market basic things ( Stock buy low sell high)
2. Familiar with setting alerts so that I buy stock when price falls to certain price.
3. Looking   for long term investment (&gt; 3Y). I fill up my 401k every year..and   75% of that is in Vanguard 500. So I am invested passively anyway.
4. The   rest of my savings, I would rather make it generate some income for me   than lie in a bank. I thought of saving for a house but I think that  is  too far ahead in the future now.
5. I am looking to invest in VOO, VOOV, VOOG, VTI as the stable ones. Was recommended PAVE, ARKK and SOXX. Any suggestions?
6. I do not want to time the market. I know the market is insanely high now. I will invest fixed amount (300$/ mo) for now.

Two questions -

1. What   is someone shares me a python script that I can use to download the   complete information of all these ETFs, and then I create my own   personal portfolio by buying individual stocks?? Will that be good??   Again - I will not be actively tracking as I am in for long.

stocks,2551546,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021",mrnfq3,psychotrader00,1618518707,27,1,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

Much less stress and all around better for my mind, don’t have a lot of time to truly analyze stocks and make good choices haha. So here’s the breakdown I was thinking:

QQQM/ VTI 40/20%
QCLN 10%
VEU 20%
ARKK 10%

I like the risk / reward with QQQM, I’m 21 and have a long road ahead of me. But Reddit loves to tout VTI so I don’t really want to miss out on it, and on the third hand I feel they’re somewhat similar despite VTI having over 3000+ holdings and QQQM having ~100. The expense ratio difference doesn’t mean much to me, its only .12% and I don’t have much to start with. I would like to do both but not a fan of the overlap in holdings. 

What are your thoughts between VTI and QQQM for a 21y/o investor? Are my other choices solid also? Should I just drop everything in VTI and let that be my portfolio? Any help is appreciated, cheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnlelx/thoughts_on_qqqm_vs_vti/,1.0
stocks,2536618,FOMO starting to hit.,mn374f,shortyafter,1617920804,80,1,"I've been investing in a target retirement fund for a few years now.  Shamelessly I took a more active approach to investing right after the GME affair, about 2 months ago.

I don't have a lot of cash, and it was clear that we were coming off of a huge bull run after the Covid crash last year.  I didn't want to throw a whole lot of money into highly-valued stocks or ETFs, like ARKK.  In the end it looks like that was the right decision, at least at that moment.  Now might be a better entry point, not sure, it's also not one that's on my radar.

So I ended up doing some pretty defensive investments that have done pretty well for me these last 2 months. In fairness, what hasn't done well?  I had limited tech exposure and even those are racing upwards after the little pullback last month.

The idea, again, was to not pour a lot of money into stocks which were potentially at ATH (sorry, I tried timing the market) and also investing in things that would do alright in the event of a correction, since I don't want to lose this money in the short-to-mid term.  Once again, so far so good.

But man, it looks like stonks always go up!  Kidding, but this bull run looks like it has no end. Monetary policy is loose.  Economy set to reopen.  Massive stimulus.  What could go wrong? (somewhat kidding)

What I'm trying to say is that I was pretty bearish when I bought in 2 months ago, and now it looks like that prediction could have been wrong, and I'm experiencing FOMO. Can anyone relate?  

I was supposed to hold some dry powder in reserve, and a little bit of an extra cushion in savings, but man right now I just wanna buy buy buy.  Thoughts?

Which ETF do you recommend? Should I even buy into an ETF?

I really like the model of ARKK but it seems like a more risky investment and there are lots of mixed reviews about it. Lots of analysis says that ARKK is too high to buy right now but it is down nearly $40 from all-time highs.

stocks,2530443,What are your highest conviction picks,mlbjdv,royalshah10,1617715344,225,1,"So it's simple what's your highest conviction stocks


So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


Quite small. I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like ""Elon Musk and Tesla are the future"".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. 

TL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.

Or do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that's just my style based on my current risk tolerance.

stocks,2510419,I save my entire income and can't stop losing money,mf6a9g,tetraethylammoniumX,1616954860,78,1,"Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.

So I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera. 

The thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.

A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the ""year of recovery"", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i ""buy the dip"" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.

I honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

stocks,2471819,ARK Trading Strategies,m6n7uy,duskick,1615939591,16,1,"As a subscriber to ARK's daily trade updates, I've been curious to watch how she trades around the volatility over the past few months.  Cathie has stated on several occasions that she uses large cap stocks as ""cash-like instruments"" and rotates into them when her conviction plays get frothy (thus expanding her total population of stocks).  When the market drops, she consolidates and concentrates the portfolio back into her high-conviction names.  I've also noticed some other interesting trades that she has made recently that piqued my interest:

**ROKU:**  ARKW bought ROKU on 3/8 (daily range $325-356), then turned around and sold ROKU from the same fund on 3/15 (daily range $354-363).  If bought at the absolute low and sold at the absolute high on those days, that would be a 12% gain.  Great return over 1 week, but if she had enough conviction to buy at $325, why sell so quickly?  

**HIMS:**  ARKG bought HIMS on 1/27 (daily range $13.00-14.40), then sold on 2/23 (daily range $14.90-17.63) when the market began to panic.  This is particularly interesting because the fund was initiating a new position in a company.  I would expect if they bought into a new company that there was some underlying thesis that should have remained intact even after a 10-20% upward move.  Interestingly, she has continued to sell out of this ticker completely.  

These are two very different examples.  

ROKU, like Tesla, is a staple of the portfolio and another strategy she uses is trading around these types of names (ARK has made lots of money trading Tesla).  Since this is a mature investment in the portfolio, she seems to have a designated percent of the portfolio she wants to allocated to it.  When the market drops 10%, she buys more to keep that percentage intact.  When it recovers, she sells off what she bought again maintaining the base percentage.  And on and on, making nice trading profits on high-conviction plays that she wants to keep at a set percentage in the fund.  She can always change that set percentage if she has more conviction in the company by letting it appreciate without selling or simply buying more.  I think this is a valuable strategy to use for high-conviction investments that you have built to a comfortable percentage of your portfolio.  

HIMS on the other hand is a small and new add to the portfolio.  I find it interesting and odd to see her buy into something completely new and then lose conviction within weeks.  Around the same time she bought HIMS, she also bought BFLY.  While she sold out of HIMS during the downturn, she gobbled up more BFLY during the same period.  This is what I would expect a fund would do when a new investment they just made goes on sale.  But while she bought more BFLY, she sold out of HIMS.  I'm curious if others have found ARK trading around small/new positions frequently (i.e. entering and exiting them completely) or if these types of transactions should be viewed as a more significant change in sentiment toward the underlying company.

I have fed Cassandra with your questions. Unfortunately, some of them make a little less sense than I had hoped, probably mostly because it still ""prefers"" to display data differently. I have copied the responses verbatim, though. I don't want you to feel cheated:

Q: Will ARKK hit new ATH this year?

A: It's a close call. If it does, it will happen before 07.2021.

Q2: ...and will I ever get 𝘮𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘥?

A: You are already married, in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What are, according to Cassandra, some of the currently most undervalued companies suitable for multi-year holds?

A: Check out TECH, DGX, HD, JPM.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: When will the US dollar cease to be the world reserve currency?

A: If you want to see a change, look East.

My comment: Ominous!

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Where will $SFT be in 6 months?

A: Its volatility makes it hard to judge and the growth rate seem slow. If the crash doesn't happen, 65% it will be ahead. If the crash happens, 25% it will be ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Ask it what 0dte spy weeklies i should trade for the best odds of not losing all my money.

A: I'm sorry, I don't take such bets.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: When will the GME squeeze happen (asking for a friend)

A: There's still a chance for a small GME squeeze but don't hold it forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: When will CD Projekt hit new ATH?

A: When CD Projekt Red aren't hacked anymore. When CD Projekt Red have shown Witcher 4.

My comment: For now, Cassie mainly considers US stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What will aapl get to by end of 2021

A: If there is a crash, higher than today. Expect 125-130 USD. If there is no crash, much higher than today. If there is no crash, expect 135-140 USD.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What kind of advantage it offers different from manual search? To be exact, is it better than me putting the ticker in my brokerage app and seeing chart etc. myself.

A: I offer no advantage to a man who doesn't see what I see. I offer my data and analysis. I see what I see. The choice is yours.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Did you feed cassie with macro data, like bonds stocks relationships, idk tariffs news, trade restriction implications etc? 

A: I know of this data but I don't fully understand this data.

My comment: She has some data from several sources, some of them paid websites. We let her scour the web and Twitter and some of her info is beyond our control right now. It's not magic though, she can't know everything.

Q2: and what she think about Blackberry?

A: Long term: Sell. Short term: Buy with caution.

My comment: Short term data applies to Friday noon.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What will the price of DVAX be at the end of 2021 ?

A: If the crash happens, expect 7 USD. If the crash doesn't happen, expect 9 USD.

My comment: This is not a stock Cassie has focused on recently.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: I would ask the bot if $GXXM is a good investment and why it is traded so low while the fair value is 237,61 USD

A: I can't see much movement in GXXM.

My comment: Yet again, it's not a stock Cassie has focused on recently. Sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Can you ask her when tech stocks are gonna make new highs?

A: If the crash happens, expect them before year end. If the crash doesn't happen, expect them to keep rising after.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Is roblox overvalued?

A: RBLX is close to where it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How much will $MANU drop when owner sells 5M shares?

A: Expect 10-15% drop.

My comment: Not one on Cassie's radar.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Is tesla going to trends up or down in the upcoming weeks

A: TSLA is volatile. Expect spikes and dips. For me it's a sell right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Can I invest in Cassandra?

A: You can always invest your time in investigating your own prophecies.

stocks,2448062,Taking Another Look at ROKU,m2vxyl,eddyjqt5,1615484402,30,1,"Hi guys today I'd like to direct your attention to Roku Inc. This stock is famously one of Cathie Woods top holdings, representing 5.97% of ARKK and 3.9% of ARKW, the third and fifth largest holdings respectively. Recently it has taken a beating and has dipped from its high of $487 down to its current price of $353. It had a historical high of $53B market cap that has now dropped down to $45B. Many people rightly regard many of ARK funds holdings cautiously with good reason- they're highly overvalued and present a lot of risk to investors who fear they may be buying at the top. With the recent downturn in prices, I think it's a good time to see if ROKU is still overvalued.


**The Business**

For those who are unfamiliar Roku is a brand of hardware media player that integrates content apps such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ etc into one platform. Roku delivers its hardware in two forms: streaming devices and licensing its operating system to smart TV manufacturers. 

Streaming devices

Roku has 5 streaming devices that are available to date. Streaming devices can be attached to the side of your television to deliver the Roku platform. Competitors include Google Chromecast, Amazing Fire stick, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV

ROKU Express - 40$. Your standard Roku box that can be hooked up to your TV with an HDMI cable
ROKU Premiere - $45 Just the ROKU Express but with HD
ROKU Streaming Stick - $70. This is a wireless version of the ROKU Premiere. 
ROKU Ultra - $100. This is the most high quality, premium product line and basically the Premiere but even better with 4K . 
ROKU Streambar - $130 Roku Ultra but with a sound system included. 

ROKU TVs

Roku licenses its software platform to television manufacturers so they can integrate them into their smart TVs. TV manufacturers get a cheap deal that allows them to create a better product without having to hire a team of developers to create their own platform from the ground up, and ROKU can gain more product adoption and users as fast as possible. 

Currently it is no exaggeration to say that ROKU is dominating the smart TV field. It is the number one smart TV platform and is integrated into approximately 40% of smart TVs sold in the USA and 31% in Canada. Roku has long term deals with all of the major TV manufacturers: Sharp, Hisense, Sky, Sanyo, TCL, etc. Their competitors in this space include Samsung who developed their own OS Tizon, LGs webOS, and the Android OS. 

In the long term, there is no doubt that consumers are shifting away from cable TV and towards streaming and Roku is a streaming company well poised to take market control here. Many older audiences who consume media are confused by how streaming works and aren't the best at navigating a Google Chromecast or Apple TV cast device. Roku is one the most intuitive product that allows this demographic to seamlessly transition into the internet streaming age. I believe this is one of their biggest differentiators as their UI/UX is extremely easy and efficient to use, and just in my anecdotal experience there's always some technical problem with other products that I never run into with ROKU. 

As of EOY 2020 Roku had 51 million active users- compare that with other streaming companies such as Netflix (204M), Amazon (150M), Disney+(87M), Hulu (39M). Their cheap ROKU streaming products and ROKU smart TV's are highly accessible and easy to set up making customer acquisition rates grow at 40%+ YOY. Their strategy is generally selling cheap products upfront to get these customers onboard, then monetize them after. This will continue as ROKU expands further into Mexico and Brazil this year. 


**Revenue Streams**

Roku has two revenue streams: Player and Platform revenue. 

Player revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from selling its Roku devices. This is the lower margin and lower revenue generating revenue stream. 

2020 Player revenue: 510M, up 30% YOY. 

Platform revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from advertising, licensing, and subscriptions. This makes up the bulk of Rokus revenue streams and has very low cost of revenue. It's effectively how well Roku can monetize its user base- and Roku has done impressively well in this regard. 

Key Metric: Average revenue per user 
2020 ARPU 28.76 (24%)
2019 ARPU 23.14 (29%)
2018 ARPU 17.95 (30%)
2017 ARPU 13.78 (76%)
2016 ARPU 7.83 

While Netflix averaged $13.32 revenue per user in 2020 Roku has averaged $28.76 per user. Roku is able to accomplishes their great ARPU mainly through their best in class advertising options. Roku has an impressive mix of advertising options that maintain a non-invasive experience for the customer while providing tons of value for the marketer. Roku's advertising options include:

For advertisers and marketers

* OneView Ad management: This is Roku's native, built in, integrated platform for demand side marketers. Roku feels that there is an increasing desire for self-serve flexibility from marketers, and OneView is the perfect product for that. OneView is a self-serve option for marketers who would like to purchase ads on Roku and integrates all of Roku's data available for marketers to use at their disposal. Previously Roku acquired Dataxu DSP and integrated it into OneView, allowing OneView to be even more efficient at obtaining and filtering the data marketers want. 

* Brand Experiences: Basically this allows companies to purchase space on Roku's home screen to push their product. Example would be below where Microsoft not only advertised their Surface laptop but also offered a free movie rental. 

https://imgur.com/a/mrRoWs1

For content creators and publishers:

* Homescreen Ads: allows purchases of space on the home screen directly to push shows. 

* Screensaver ads: Roku has a screensaver that turns on when you leave your device untouched for too long. Companies can purchase screensaver space to advertise

* Video ads when users watch the free Roku channel (can purchase either 15 seconds or 30 seconds)

* Primetime Ads: Allows companies to purchase slots on Roku home page for their shows at peak streaming hours. 

Here is an example of Disney pushing their new movie ""Soul"" by purchasing ad space

https://imgur.com/gallery/EZAjBCo

In March 2021 Roku also announced it is expanding its partnership with Nielsen, as Roku will acquire Nielsens Advanced video advertising (AVA) business. This includes video automatic content recognition, ad content measurement tech, and dynamic ad insertion tech. This will be huge for ROKU as it will now be able to integrate the Nielsen ""always on"" digital ad ratings into its OneView platform for marketers. 

It is important to note here that Roku will only show advertisements to users if they are watching from the Roku channel. If users are watching Netflix or any of the other third party app such as Hulu they will not view advertisements. Again, Roku stresses a non-invasive advertising strategy for its users. 

**Financials and Valuation**

*Income Statement*

Roku is posting another unprofitable year while they attempt to expand as much as possible, although 2020 was very nearly a break-even year with net 17M in losses. Q3 and Q4 for Roku this year were profitable, and I personally expect ROKU to be break profit overall for 2021. Roku's weakest quarters historically are the first two of the year with sales and profit picking up in Q3 and Q4, and Roku guidance points towards that trend continuing for the 2021 year. 

Roku offered guidance for the Q1 2021 with 51% YOY increase to $485M and EBITDA of $31M. Overall, Q1 is expected to be unprofitable as usual for Roku, as it is their weakest quarter historically. There is an estimated $40M in stock based compensation in Q1 as well as $10M in depreciation, and management has estimated net income at roughly $(20M). This is still a large improvement YOY from the $(55M) from Q1 2020. 


*Balance Sheet*

Current Ratio sits at 2.5 so Roku is safely able to continue operating without a problem for the near future. 

Their largest liability is ""accrued liabilities"" which increased 75% YOY. This is largely due to the fact that Roku has been acquiring rights to stream content for free on their ROKU channel and has doubled their payments due to content publishers. Their marketing accrued liabilities increase 6 fold as they attempt to expand even further, and the lease payments for a new office doubled as they expanded their facilities. Aside from this their debt remains in line with the 2019 year with no other notable debts. 

*Cash Flow*

Roku has 1.1B in cash however was only able to increase net cash by 140M through operating activities- vast majority of its cash is raised via financing another round in May 2020. There is continued risk of share dilution here. 

*DCF*

Very basic construction of DCF here, forecasted out 5 years with a WACC of 10 and perpetuity growth rate of 3%. Revenues growing at 45% down to 38%. Net profit margin projected to be 5% in 2021 up to 15% in 2025. Ultimately yielded approximately $105B in total value, $722 per share (assuming no more share dilution). Again, it was a just a back of the napkin DCF so there was no sensitivity tables or even de-levering FCF etc. 

I believe that this is in line with ROKU's potential to become a 90 billion market cap company. 

*Multiples Valuation*

EV/Revenue multiple

Roku EV = 44,642,527,000
EV/Revenue = 25.12

The deal with Roku is that its competitors are large players- Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple, and Netflix. Of these, we can only reliably compare Roku multiples with Netflix as its too difficult to reliably separate the streaming segments out of the other companies financials. 

Netflix EV= 304B
Netflix EV/Revenue= 12.16

As you can see, despite Netflix carrying loads of debt Netflix still has the more reasonable valuation. There is continued risk here that ROKU is overvalued. 


**The Bull case**

Roku continues its growth as outlined in my DCF of 45% down to 30% in the next 7 years. I believe this is entirely possible as Rokus platform revenue is growing at a 70% rate and should only increase as their ARPU increases. 

Roku has an insane ARPU compared to other companies. While Netflix may have 4 times the users, it has far slower growth in ARPU as the business model doesn't allow for much monetization. Reed Hastings in January 2021 reiterated that Netflix will not monetize its users any further by offering advertising options because it would be too difficult to compete with the big players in advertisement (Google/Amazon/Facebook). 

Roku has proven Netflix wrong in this area for certain. The bull case is Roku continues to grow its ARPU- giving extremely conservative estimates of growing at 12% per year ARPU could level off in 3 years at $40. 

As Roku expands its user base further globally the ARPU could potentially even have years where it contracts after that. However, I won't say that I can confidently give any bull case regarding international expansion as no guidance was offered in the reports or conference calls. 

ROKU has also been acquiring more and more content rights to add to the ROKU Channel. Roku recently acquired rights to Quibi and stated in the conference call that they will continue the trend in the future. 

**Bear Case**

At this point insolvency in the foreseeable future is too unlikely to be considered for Roku. However, there absolutely is a future where growth may slow down after COVID as peoples lives return to normalcy more. COVID provided many growth opportunities for Roku with people staying at home all day, and as that tapers off there is a chance growth will as well. 

Roku is still overvalued at a 25x revenue multiple. It's not as expensive as PLTR or SNOW, but just purely by revenue multiples it's more overvalued than Tesla at any point in 2020. 

**Conclusion**

You can draw your own conclusion from the information I've laid out, but I believe Roku is a great pickup right now. 

Roku's greatest strength is its focus on monetizing its users and the plethora of advertising options available for advertisers. It's $28 ARPU beats out Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, and many other companies by far. Granted it does not have the international reach of those companies which should bring the ARPU down, but even comparing their US audience ARPU Roku blows surpasses many other advertisement based businesses. 

It's recent partnership with Nielsen is fantastic for advertisers and should give them more tools at their disposal. I believe that the market that Roku operates in will only grow, as cable cutting continues, and that out of all its competitors Roku has the best offerings for advertisers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2vxyl/taking_another_look_at_roku/,1.0

My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it’s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):

Now for the StoNKs advice:

DEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50.

Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday after new data showed muted levels of inflation in consumer goods, helping quell fears of a rapid jump in prices during the economic recovery. Treasury yields retreated following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.521% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.46% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.59% up. After recordings its best day since April 2020, the Nasdaq fell 0.29%.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. 

Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco said of inflationary jitters: “ “There’s the irony that in year one of a market recovery everybody doubts it and says how can this be happening if the economy isn’t good, and then in year two everybody struggles to assess whether \[the economy has\] just gotten too good too fast and it’s too hot. And so the last few days have been the latter story: Markets being disrupted by concerns of inflation and higher rates and premature Fed tightening. And today’s a little bit of a reprieve on that story as rates come down a bit and investors can start thinking about longer duration assets again.”

Today, in Washington DC, the House of Representatives is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed by the Senate over the weekend. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify, is expected to easily pass and be signed into law by President Biden in the coming days.

* General Electric (GE) announced a reverse 1-8 split, meaning that every 8 shares of GE will be converted to 1 share worth roughly $112 given the current $14 stock price. The reason is too lower the float of GE to be more comparable with industry peers.

stocks,2440977,What are some good UK etfs equivalent to ones available in the US?,m1xwog,Buff_Seercull,1615384359,2,1,"First post here (but been lurking for a few months).

Reading the posts here I can see how good many of the American ETFs are for long term investing (i.e. SPY and ARKK seem to be peoples favourites). However these aren't available in the UK and I was hoping people could help with identifying the best UK ETFs that track the same indexes and aren't susceptible to large descrepancies (if the UK version is traded in much lower volume and doesn't accurately reflect the index) or much higher management fees. I'm using a T212 ISA if that helps in identifying ETFs that aren't available with specific brokers.

A bit of background: I started my account in January as I got fed up with my cash ISA only having an interest rate of 0.1%. My current portfolio is predominately companies which I expected to have a strong post-covid bounce back this year and has been doing very well so far (10-45% returns in a month and a half, averages out at 25%) but I know this won't last and have set my exit positions. I'm interested in ETFs after this for long-term growth and investment, and those that track the US market appear much better than those that track FTSE 100 in the UK, which seems to be a fairly stagnent/slow growing market overall. I'm in my late 20's so don't have a lot to invest, also I can't add much cash throughout the year as rent is \~65% of income, but growth is better than 0.1%. Finally as I'm using a stocks and shares ISA all profit from growth and dividends is tax free, the only tax I'll need to pay is 0.5% stamp duty when buying shares.

1. Holding out on buying in hopes if it goes bad i get in on a huge dip today or tomorrow. Know after today that when they recover its going to be fine. Yesterdays green market should have showed everyone that tech isnt dead and will bounce right back. 

2. If i don't buy in and it goes well and everything recovers... it means im no longer in the red and tech will start making money again. 

Its a win win but also no idea what way itll go. 

I set some low buy orders just above the most recent lowest drop from a few days ago. Banking that its gonna drop once markets open as people take profits and wait for bond auction before buying back in. If i miss out and the stocks rocket ill catch them on the way up. Either way buying in now is better and lower still than if i bought in a month ago.

I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon.

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up into what they are today, what, in your eyes are those stocks and why?

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

ARK is very appealing to me and I've been reading up alot on their different ETFs and I've seen alot of talk about ARKK, obviously, and ARKF. Other then ARKK, the one that catches my eye the most is ARKQ but I don't ever see anyone talking about or mentioning it really. It seems to me like it has massive potential as autonomous cars come closer to reality. The number 1 occupation world wide is drivers, wether that be cabs, delivery, long haul trucking, etc. That's ALOT of companies that would benefit massively from removing that labour cost, which to me would translate to a massive interest in buying those technologies when they become available.

Am I missing something that is not as appealing about ARKQ versus their other funds that has people not as excited about buying?

stocks,2428722,ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21,m038nl,rareliquid,1615162207,21,1,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting). 

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon 
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations** 
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies  
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research** 

**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings): 
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment 
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future 
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency 
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency 
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation 
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon 

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 34% 
   * LTM gross margins: 71% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x 
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising 
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 46% 
   * LTM gross margins: 48% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x 
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies 
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 27% 
   * LTM gross margins: 87% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%) 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x 
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data. 
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 34% 
   * LTM gross margins: 57% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x 
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain 
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 33% 
   * LTM gross margins: 53% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x 
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m038nl/arkk_innovation_fund_top_5_stock_picks_week/,1.0

2. Palantir's biggest customers are government organizations. They are probably structured to work with those government organizations effectively.

stocks,2418764,The case for inflation: Simple math in layman's terms,lx6y06,seldomsage,1614813083,80,71,"Hi team,

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

**********************

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders). Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!

**********************

What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.

What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We'll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven't been able to do for the last 12 months.

This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.

**********************

Let's look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.

***Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019***

1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5***

1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself***

1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)

**********************

It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:

*""How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?""*

In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about ***double digit annualized inflation rates...*** 

*AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.*

Inflation rates may be *much higher* than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

**********************

What does it mean for r/stocks and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell:

1. Nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate values will increase (REITs), the prices of all *real assets* will increase.

2. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

3. The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don't have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.

4. Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.

5. Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called ""long-duration"" equities, many of which are favorites on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on *negative earnings*. 

6. In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in *higher equity risk premiums*, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. 

7. Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

8. Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income and wealth inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

I also bought a share of BUD because it looks a lot like United Airlines before I picked that up at $40 a month ago. Like it’s going to bounce back once events start happening and people start (rampantly) drinking. 

My other positions are all technology stuff (I was so stoked on SQ yesterday and also today my DM dipped lower than I ever expected - ‘bought the dip’ when it was much higher than it is now) and I’m down 8% from yesterday and now I’m down more than 25% overall.

stocks,2382986,A Warning About ARK Funds,ltuvbp,yikejaw,1614452467,206,0,"Before you downvote: I dont hold a long or short position in any ARK fund or their holdings

This week has been a bad week for tech and growth stock investors in general. The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.

Well thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.

A lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.

If ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.

*Live Updates*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Thanks to you I learned about Roth IRAs and most likely will be opening it soon. I have some follow up questions.

* My style will be closer to ""set it and forget it"".
* Therefore predominantly I will be buying index funds or ETFs like VTI, VUG, QQQ or ARKK.
* So far I use Fidelity but can switch any time.

I have some follow ups that so far I couldn't find online.

1. So, if I buy VTI, does it mean I better off having Roth IRA with Vanguard then? I read somewhere about how you pay the ETF fees and looks like if you have an account with the same broker who manages that ETF it will be cheaper. How important is this?
2. Lately what caught my eye is Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which is a robo advisor. Did anyone compare what is better: robo advisor like Marcus or investing in ETFs? Sounds like the same thing, with ETFs having a little more control.
3. I would appreciate if you recommend any great beginner materials/reads to educate myself about investing. So far I mostly used Investopedia and NerdWallet and some materials from Fidelity. As an immigrant, the first time I heard about investing is from this subreddit, so I guess I need to do a little extra work since you are the only people I can ask))
4. Oh, and would you recommend how to choose ETFs? The above were most popular. But in what proportion? And how would you pick? From what I read in this subreddit looks like people go the most for VUG - 70%, ARKK - 15% and QQQ - 15%. Or something like that. What about index funds?

stocks,2370175,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, February 24, 2021. Please enjoy!",lrohvp,psychotrader00,1614204754,39,14,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**

Stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. 

In the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. 

During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, “a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery”. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US’ ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.

In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.

**Highlights**

* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!
* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We’re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well. 
* U.S. new home sales jumped by 4.3% in January over December, the [Commerce Department reported Wednesday ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)morning, far exceeding expectations as a jump in housing market activity last year extended into the beginning of the new year. We have been banging the table on mortgage REITs for a while now, still way below pre-pandemic levels and a great long-term opportunity in our view.
* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the road for the third vaccine to receive emergency use authorization in the US.
* Despite a recent video showing one of their engines catching on fire, shares of Boeing (BA) gapped up today.
* Dell Tech (DELL) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $85 to $90 at Overweight. Stock currently around $80

stocks,2369818,Prediction- March 10th will be another shitshow in the market. A (brief) $RBLX DD. (and maybe numerous issues with your other trades/broker),lrltbv,electricp0ww0w,1614196496,61,58,"Ok guys, bear with me. Aplogies in advance if I get anything wrong. I just wanna have discussion on Roblox, where it's going, what happens and why the market could goof us retail guys again. I'm no expert. Im not financial pro. I just sit at home all day reading about stocks and learning new stuff.

Quick backstory, Roblox is dropping onto the market on March 10th via DPO. A DPO is a direct public offering. It's similar to an IPO, but in simple terms, it slams onto the market, for everyone at the same time.

Remember the debacle with AirBNB and DoorDash? They were IPO's, scooped up by the hedgies and big boys. When retail wanted to buy, the price was stupid high and a lot of people got the rug pulled out from them. My understanding is the prices have settled now, but that day was a huge shitshow with retail buying power seriously hindered by the volume, demand, prices and platforms of retail brokers. 

Roblox will be ten times worse.

I'll make this next bit quick. (Edit - I lied, this next bit isn't quick but it is necessary). - 

**What is Roblox?**

Roblox is a MONEY PRINTER. Seriously. Maybe you're not into games, or have no kids or whatever. Basically, think of it as something like minecraft. Its a computer game for kids. The characters are made up of blocks, and run around online, meeting other players, doing little games, meeting each other, performing tasks etc. I don't really know, i've never played it but watched some YT vids of people playing. In simple terms, it's good honest child friendly fun, which even adults can have a laugh with. 

It runs on Console, PC and mobile. Roblox has 1600 employees dedicated to removing hate speech and offensive things. There was a link to some far right groups using Roblox. As soon as they were found out by the press, Roblox banned them outright. My understanding is that as far as online gaming goes, it's very safe and good for kids, without much toxic language or offensive things that can upset young kids. It seems Roblox take their shit seriously in respect of this. 

~ Let's quickly talk numbers ~

First off, let's drop the Tsar Bomba (aka the biggest mofo nuclear bomb ever made) of figures;

From wiki - *From February 2020 to January 2021, Roblox experienced an increase in valuation from $4 billion to $29.5 billion, an increase attributed largely to the pandemic.*

**29 MOTHERFUDGING BILLION IN 11 MONTHS.**

Read that last line again before we continue. 

Next up, lets talk players. Again, wiki;

**As of August 2020, Roblox has over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States**

164 MILLION.  Let me put that into perspective. I want you to imagine every single person in Argentina, Ghana, Saudia Arabia, Cuba, Sweden, Israel, Hong Kong, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Switzerland. That's how many people are active on RBLX each month. Mental. Now, obviously I could have just said 50% of the USA but that's boring.

Now don't get me wrong, its not up to the heights of things like PUBG, Fortnite or Runescape, but it's 30% more popular than World of Warcraft and 50% more popular than GTA. 
Oh, and RBLX is *free to play*. However, it generates its money from ""Robux"". Basically, you can pay for these Robux as a form of currency, which you can then spend on special abilities in game. If I had $1 every time I read on Reddit, as user saying ""all my kid asks for at Christmas and birthdays is these damn Robux coin things"", then i'd have enough $$$ to take on SpaceX. It seems like kids just lap this shit up all the time, and parents seem fairly happy to pay for it because it's a fun game with no toxic assholes. It certainly has less of the agressive, competitive stigma and negative traits that has been attached to games like Fortnite. 

Anyway, go and do you own DD on this. I'm sure there are some negatives to be found, so go take a look.  All you really need to know is that RBLX is a motherfakin JUGGERNAUGHT of online gaming. In 2020 it had a revenue of *$2.2 billion* across all platforms. 

**""Hey Electricpowow what is the point of all this crap about robollocks or something?**

Ok listen up and lets get to the point; this is my own sheer prediciton and that's it.... But, RBLX is going to be the MOTHER of all meme stonks. Seriously. It's a silly game with huge values and various other subreddits will find it hilarious to send Roblox to the moon. Mainly because of how simple it is. It's just got the whole aire of a meme stock about it. Even those that want to make it a meme stock believe deep down that it actually is a solid money maker at heart. The fact it's a silly kids video game makes it even sweeter. We know what the retail power is when it comes to video game related stock matters....

Secondly, ignoring people who post rocket emojis and apes, this kinda stuff is gonna be loved by boomers. What do boomers have? Kids. What do kids talk about all day long? Roblox. These are the same boomers who invest in Apple because their 14 year old never shuts up about how amazing the next iPhone will be. They'll be doing the same with their small kids on the Blox. I've even seen some redditors saying they'll be buying Roblox as a long term investement then gift it to their kids in 14 years time for their 18th, like it's some sort of damned Roblox based trust fund or some crazy shit. Can you imagine Cramer trying to explain League of Legends to his boomer audience? Well he doesn't need to explain Roblox because the boomer's kids talk about it all day. 

Now, the whole point of this is that.... EVERYONE is gonna want a slice of the Roblox pie. Even more so, that its coming out as an DPO. That means you and Papa Musk and horrible nasty Uncle Melvin will be able to buy RBLX at the same time. My understanding is they usually list at about midday. 

Now, why is Blox going to be a DPO and not an IPO? **They actually wanted to list as an IPO several months ago**. Wait, sorry that's not right. They wanted to list as an IPO **TWICE** and pulled out. Why? Well, one reason is that their accounting needed a closer examination, but the primary reason was because they saw the utter shitshow that was AirBNB. They saw AirBNB moon all the way past Jupiter and in no time at all, it nailed back down to earth with more power then a Michael Jordan slam dunk. 

In short, Roblox guys realised that IPO's are quite unstable with big companies, so they do DPO. I also think that a DPO somehow lets current investors safely leave their positions without getting burned or something, but im unsure on this. 

It also means that the DPO price will be much higher than an IPO starting price. This in turn brings some stability. My understanding is the expected IPO price was going to be about $5 per share, whereas the DPO price will be around $45/s. 45 Dollars a share is still pretty damn cheap. 

Now, consider that Andreessen Horowitz are one of their big investors. Ok, so who the hell is Andrew Hogwartz? That shit don't matter, all you need to know is that their track record of investment in young companies is as follows -

Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Lyft, Occulus VR, GitHub, BuzzFeed and loads of others. Oh and they also dumped 800 million into Crypto in the last 5 years. What's the theme here? Tech based software stocks that balloon in value. That's what. I think its fair to say, that when it comes to tech and software, Andreas Hobofizz knows exactly what they are doing. And they've dumped their money and reputation into the Blox. 

Now, with all this said what does this mean? It means everyone will want a slice of the RBLX cake. Boomers who's kids never shut up about it. People who like tech stocks. Gamers. Meme train riders. Investement funds and big hedgies. Everyone can see that RBLX is a money machine. And in fairness, $45/s is modest when you dive deep into the numbers. 

TakeTwo interactive (Grand Theft Auto) is $186/s. Activision is at $95/s. Tencent (who do Leage of Legends, another HUGE multiplayer online game) is at $88/s. Electronic arts, $137/s. 

Yadadayablah you get the idea. The only real big name I can find which is near the RBLX price is Nintendo at $78/s. (This is for another day but I think Nintendo is massively undervalued - Maybe thats why Cathy and her ARKK have been constantly buying it of late?)

So, what is my whole point of this? If you got this far, good work, because i'm a moron and my hands hurt from all this typing but I like you guys so ima carry on...

Thing is, on March 10th. Every man and his dog is gonna want to throw some money at the Blox. And what happens when everyone wants to buy? Our shitty retail brokers... break. They have 'outages', they are slow, they don't process orders quickly etc etc. Maybe this is because of the huge volume and demand. Tin foil hat wearers will say it's all orcestrated, to freeze out retail while the hedgies get into the Blox at 45/s and we can't get in until 90/s, just like what happened with AirBNB and DoorDash. 

Note this, in all the reading i've done so far about RBLX, I've not seen a single article that is offering negative sentiment about it. I saw a fair amount of negative sentiment about the other two in the buildup, but especially DoorDash. 

So, obviously you can set your limits, but this won't work if the price is zooming around and the volume is being gobbled up. Oh yeah, volume. 199 million shares will be up for grabs. 

AirBNB put out 50 million. I think DD put out about 35 million. So... RBLX is putting out a lot of shares... But I also think it's gonna have much more interest than the companies I just mentioned...

I don't know what the answer or solution is here if you do wanna buy it. I personally think (in the short term), it'll be bigger than a certain recent StopGame share in terms of interest. I honestly believe everyone will want some of this, and as retail investors, we're likely gonna get boned. *again*. 

Now this also extends to people who might not care about RBLX. If you shitty broker goes down, or lags, or won't connect because everyone wants some blox, then good luck selling that pennystock you've been sat on for a while when March 10th is the perfect time to sell. It *might* have a knock on effect on your ability to perform other trades so please bear it in mind. You spot an amazing buy on American Airlines but unlucky bro, you cant because your shitty phone based broker has another 'outage' because everyone wants to buy rublix or some shit. Maybe people could set up a couple of brokers to give them the best chance of a buy? Remember some brokers want proof of earnings and stuff so consider this sooner rather than later if you want in on this partay. 

Finally; Ever seen or heard someone online say *""oof""*? Its a Roblox meme that's been around for years. Its the noise a character makes when it gets hurt or falls over. Its another meme version of 'RIP'.  I hope March 10th isnt a big **oof** for retail.

And that's it guys and girls. I'd love to hear thoughts on this. At least give me the dignity of telling me my DD and entire post sucks. This will justify the 25 minutes I spent typing this out. 

My position? I'm unsure at the moment. I'm 50/50 between going total YOLO on Roblox on the 10th and either sitting out totally, or just trying to open a small position to see if I'm right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrltbv/prediction_march_10th_will_be_another_shitshow_in/,0.85

* PLTR (Palantir)  - 17% - Somewhat familiar with this company, they were coming to our campus every year and it was fun. I do believe they have future and they just out of IPO. Great long term potential I think.
* QS (QuantumScape) - 16% - literally read about them on Bloomberg that Soros was buying. Since it is battery company I bought it too. Fun stonk, risky of course.

stocks,2319545,"Do you expect higher-risk ETFs like QQQ, ICLN, ARKK, and ARKG to recover from crashes and undergo long-term growth over 10 years?",loa4fw,napoleoninrags98,1613837030,43,1,"I'm a beginner investor so I'm really sorry if this question seems naïve!

We know that an ETF like VOO has always had overall growth over the decades. Do you feel that these ETF's will grow overall over the next decade?

I'm 22 and interested in passive long-term investing by dollar-cost averaging (though I'm open to lump sum, but am reluctant at the moment since the market is at an all time high!). The problem is, I've realized that investing purely in the VOO (which has an average return of 8%) will mean that I won't really be able to enjoy my wealth until I'm like 60, and given my age, I'm open to accepting a little bit of risk. So, I'm trying to increase the return rate on my Portfolio by investing about 20 of it into these riskier stocks that I expect to do well.

But are they any more likely than VOO or VTI to not recover from a crash? Or do you think that with patience, they'll eventually steadily climb higher over the course of a decade? I realise no one truly has the answer to these questions, but I'm basically asking about the likelihood and predictability of long term growth (over, say, 5 - 10 years).

Perhaps more importantly though: do you guys have a method or principle for knowing when to eventually sell these things? I'd like to reinvest any profit I make from risky ETF's into VOO after 5 - 10 years, or other medium-risk ETF's that seem more promising in the future.

Just don't want to be throwing my money into these every month if there's a chance they'll stay down in the long-term after a crash - but if things do work out, how should I know when to sell?

Also, do you think it might be more effective just to invest 100% of my portfolio into something like VOO?

stocks,2277543,SPCE DD - Test Flight Delay,lkuejg,hooman_or_whatever,1613445192,58,7,"Hello all!

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;amp;amp;V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. 

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Key Staff and Players:**

Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

**Noteworthy Investors**:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America  
Morgan Stanley  
ARK  
Boeing  
Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)

**Partners**:  
Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;amp;amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

People tend to say that stocks are riskier but can lead to stronger gains than ETFs/index funds, which tend to be slower and less volatile. However, I’ve seen several ETFs (ARKK, YOLO, DRIV, etc.) show massive gains over the past 1 and 5 year periods (80-100% and 150+% respectively). This growth sounds just as strong, if not stronger than regular stocks, and the volatility and risk is greatly reduced.

Hey I'm relatively new to these ARK funds. I currently hold ten percent ARKK and wanted to put another 5 percent in another ARK fund and was hoping for ARKG. However when I go through the weightings of ARKG's holdings it seems they are a lot of small and medium cap companies. My worry is that ARK owns around ten percent of these companies and this is quite a risky play.

Does ARKG manage too much money for them to achieve what they want to do in ARKG or is my logic flawed. I truly believe genomics is a great ten year strategy but is this fund too big to be nimble enough to navigate this volatile area? I notice recently they are buying into bigger pharma companies (Roche, Takeda, Nov) is this just to park cash or is there an actual genomics play here. A quick glance at their pipeline I couldn't find much.

stocks,2223674,How to fix my investments before I hurt them any further?,lhxxg6,pleasesolvefory,1613086103,54,1,"Hi all,

Before getting into it: I'm 32 years old living in Los Angeles. Currently employed at a tech company. Current income in $195k. Currently married with our first kid on the way.

So I came to the very hard realization today that I was addicted to gambling, especially in options trading. I got super lucky one time with Game Stop and made around $200k profit split between my Roth IRA and my broker account. My Roth IRA I have reconfigured to put all that money into VTSAX and some into ARKK as a set it and forget it.

My problem is that this past week, I stupidly got caught in the wind of fomo and just yesterday bought leaps on weed stocks, particularly APHA and TLRY. My APHA leap expires in Jan 2022 and TLRY in Jan 2023. Today was an absolute blood bath, and I watched my portfolio slowly bleed.

In my broker account, it grew from $35k to $170k after I sold Game Stop, but it still hurts to have made such a stupid, greedy decision with the weed stocks. I know for sure I don't want to screw up my incredibly lucky gains, so to stop the further bleeding I am tempted to close all my positions right now at a loss. As of right now, my portfolio is around $139k, so technically still house money, but I don't want to ruin it all completely. This is supposed to be money to help buy a home in the next 2 to 3 years.

My questions:

Should I cut my losses RIGHT now, and just put all that money into VTI or some other safer and reliable ETF?

Or is it better for me to wait it out just a little bit since I have time on the leaps and hopefully I can sell at a smaller loss, at which point I would still just put it all into an ETF?

I know I've made incredibly stupid decisions and I'm trying to set myself up properly right now so I don't continue down this path. Seeing my portfolio lose so much money so quickly was a huge eye opener for me, and I don't want to go through that moving forward. Feel free to call me a dumb ass or an idiot, but I know I'll be staying far away from options trading now. I just need to know the best route to manage this.

stocks,2219034,Message to other young investors,lhs005,presidentgertler,1613070499,1868,1,"For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my ""fun"" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month. I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon.

stocks,2099802,My attempt at the “Reddit ETF”,lbp8a8,_usernamepassword_,1612364075,25,3,"Reddit (and social media in general) has, in my opinion, a very interesting mix of strategies and approaches when it comes to trading/investing. A good portion here are looking for short/medium term gains with mild risk. Some play it safer, investing in index funds and ETF’s relying on long-term growth. Another percentage is looking to get rich quick, dumping their life savings into a single stock. 

I know the idea for a “Reddit ETF” has been floated here before, and I personally believe that with the aforementioned mix of DD/risk tolerance, it would perform exceptionally well. With several users posting a weekly recap of the most discussed stocks, I have decided to pull 10 stocks from these lists and invest $150 in each of them, totaling $1,500 in this “ETF.” The “Reddit ETF” consists of the following. 

-ARKK
-MSFT
-AMZN
-ICLN
-SPCE
-AAPL
-PLTR
-TSLA
-BB
-NOK

As much as I would love to invest more, I have a particularly small portfolio at the moment (life meant I had to pull most of my investments last year. Needed the money for immediate use). However, I do plan on contributing additional funds on a weekly basis to help grow. My questions for Reddit are as follows

-Is 10 different stocks too many? Too few? 

-At what point should I drop or sell of an underperforming/less discussed stock? Should I reevaluate the stocks included in the ETF weekly? Monthly? 

-When investing additional cash, should I evenly divide my investment across all stocks (I.E. if putting in an additional $150, put $10 in each stock)? Or should additional investments favor the better performing stocks?

I would love any feedback or suggestions! I plan on posting updates on a semi-regular basis (probably once or twice a month).

This week I transferred several retirement accounts that had been sitting around in various places all into Schwab.  Fortunately for me, they all sold into cash right before this dip.  Now that the power is in my hands, I've been thinking about how to safely buy back in with potential volatility on the horizon (or not?).

The idea is to not buy in all at once, but rather buy in with 1/6 of my lump sum every month for 6 months (or 1/12 every month for 12 months).  If in that time a recognizable correction (&gt;8%) comes about, just buy all-in at that point.

I'd appreciate your thoughts and critiques of my brilliant plan.

stocks,1344136,Tracking the the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here’s the results for this week.,l6mjy8,smshowoff,1611803674,81,15,"# And the breakouts and 🚀 of next week:

&amp;#x200B;

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending (like spotting those 🚀🚀).

As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not, or to use some automated brokerages like [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) with algo-investor models based on these sentiment analyses. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Yes, I’ve read the sidebar.",l4giyj,ToyotaHellcat,1611551094,0,1,"I'm currently a nineteen year old freshman in college, I've been working since the summer after sophomore year of high school and have made nearly $33,000 in total. Currently, I have $26,000 so in the past two and a half years, I've spent an estimated $7,000, which is a lot more than I expected, but I did buy a new phone, had a girlfriend for most of those two and a half years, and paid for gas on a gas-guzzling truck. Obviously did some fun stuff too and paid for a lot of food. Is that a lot?

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all that, I have $12,000 (2020 &amp; 2021) invested into a Roth IRA with most of my shares being in QQQ and VTI (nearly 85%). The rest is in ARKK and VXUS. I still have a remaining $700 to invest in the Roth, any recommendations? The $12,000 is now $13,300 (+10%) but the $6,000 invested this year was done on Friday so technically it's $6,000 that turned into $7,300.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an ETRADE account with $6,000 invested (mainly long term holds), which has turned into $8,250 (+36%). My positions are a bit scattered so if you'd want to know the specifics I can list them.

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with just shy of $8,000 in cash and I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm fortunate enough to have my parent's paying for my college and most likely my first car when the time comes so I don't have any big expenses coming my way. They'd also pay for any emergency bills as long as it wasn't a stupid decision that put me in an emergency situation. Do I invest more of it? I'd expect to make around $12,000/yr for the next 4 years, unless I bumped up my hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a credit card with Discover with a current credit score of 803. Very small limit though, only $1,250 but I'm not dumb with it, I understand it's not free money like some people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I find another place to invest my money, save for the rest of the year, do something else?

(NOTE: sorry, mods keep deleting my post because of youtube link. You can search for ""ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) N-1A Filing"" on youtube and it should show up) 

ARKX will go public some time after 3/29/2021.

Theme: Invest in companies that are engaged in leading, enabling, or benefitting from products/services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.

ARKX has 4 investment categories: Orbital Aerospace, Suborbital Aerospace, Enabling Technologies, and Aerospace Beneficiary.

Risk Factors:

1. Concentrate (&gt;25% of the fund’s assets) in industrial sector and information technology sector.
2. Currency risk: a strong US dollar will negatively affect the fund due to the non-US stock holding in the fund.
3. Aerospace and Defense industry is heavily depending on US government’s demand and other government’s demand around the world.
4. Newly offered fund. No performance history is available.

Upside:

1. Credibility: Cathie Wood and the success of ARK Invest ETFs (ARKK, ARKQ, …)
2. Promising of incredible return
3. The fund’s portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated daily.

I was holding it to watch the market to see if I should invest on any large dips or crashes, but since I can’t take any money out of this account until I’m 60, I’m not sure if that applies to this tax free account. For comparison, I have about 13k in a taxable brokerage in which 40% is cash - this account was started more recently so I am still doing My DD on how  i want to spend this money.

If it helps, I plan to rebalance My Roth 2x a year only if needed and I manage my taxable brokerage a few days a week depending on My schedule and what trades I feel need short term maintenance.

Thank you!

stocks,1074287,Reddit Trading Recap January 19,l10tec,prostockadvice,1611113910,6,0,"I closed $LI, $PLTR, $ARKK, $ARKG yesterday all in the green for a small profit.

**Current Positions**

* **$AMD** \- Of my positions right now, this is the one underperforming the most. Eventually $AMD will hit $100, and we have until April for that to happen. This one is not urgent. Although considering how much $SMH, $SOXX and $SOXL went up yesterday, I'm a little surprised $AMD is dragging its feet.
* **$IPOD and $ICLN** \- Both of these positions improved today. Let's see if tomorrow we can turn a profit. The fundamentals are still pointing towards a huge upward swing and the technical's are showing a good buying opportunity.
* **$PFE** \- Pfizer didn't move yesterday; completely flat. I still believe this is a good buying opportunity since more and more people will be taking the vaccine. I'd get into a long term option or buy commons if you have the capital available. 4h chart shows it is holding at the support line I drew on the last report.

**Watchlist**

* **$ERX -** You probably have figured out by now that I am bullish on clean energy. This is a great tool to get exposure to the clean energy sector. $ERX is a clean energy ETF advised by Direxion Funds. This is a 2x exposure. What that means is you will get a leveraged positions without using leverage. 2x the exposure as you normal would as with $ICLN. My take on this is clean energy will go up in 2021, possibly by a lot. Getting back into the Paris Accord is right around the corner, and the new administration is not very friendly toward non-renewable and non-clean energy. $ERX is currently in a nice upwards trend. I'm buying commons or LEAPS in the rectangle below \~$17. Price target would be $24-$26, pending on how long you want to hold this. Be careful with the decay on leveraged ETFs. They need to go up more than what they go down, if prices drop.
* **$LMND -** Lemonade is a peer to peer property and casualty insurance company that is popular with millennials. They have an easy to use app, and one can get covered and submit a claim in only minutes. They make insurance easy. I believe this is the future of insurance, and it is not the first time I've come across something like this. On the chart below we can see that $LMND is currently pulled back to the middle Bollinger band, but still in an uptrend overall. I'll be watching this the next few days or weeks to see which way it wants to go.
* **$LAC** \- Lithium Americas Corp is a resource company that focuses on mining Lithium. With the growing demand for EV and Lithium batteries, you must see where I'm going with this one. I've been eyeing this for a while, and it is up 30% today. I foresee this pulling back more before continuing its climb. Buying price target is $22.50 and I'd buy LEAPS or commons to sell covered calls with. If you don't mind capital tied up, sell a put around this buy target and run the wheel strategy.

**I hope you guys appreciate this. I love anything investing related; its my passion.**

stocks,1067345,Would anyone care to let me know if what I plan to do makes any sense? (Canadian),kzpmlu,sleepmode80,1610953831,17,1,"Hey guys, turning 30 this year and finally realized I should start putting my savings to use. :P So last week I downloaded wealthsimple and opened 3 accounts: the default personal, a tfsa, and an rrsp and I expect my funds to be deposited around Tuesday. I’ve been doing some reading and watching videos while I wait and what I plan to do is:

Personal account: start out small, investing in med-long hold stocks just to see how it goes. Starting with about 2k, thinking split between NIO, AAPL, AMD, SUNW, and maybe a couple other more stable growth companies. I’m not looking forward to learning how to deal with stocks on my taxes and probably paying taxes for the first time in my life but it’s a necessary chore.

TFSA: from my understanding, to not be taxed (the purpose of the account) these have to be Canadian, so I plan on pumping the full 6k into Canadian EFTs, probably half ZQQ, and either VFV or VCN for the rest.

RRSP: I plan on putting only American EFTs here since it sounds like you don’t pay any taxes on American stocks if it’s through an RRSP. I don’t make much money so I can only contribute about 5k a year which I plan to go about 3k ARKK, and the remaining 2k on another EFT, I haven’t quite decided yet.

I was quite surprised to read that you can’t just dump 20k into an RRSP if you have it, just because you are on a lower income, but I guess it makes sense to prevent people from going ham and losing all their money? So I guess I just have to be patient with this and the TFSA.

So from my understanding: personal account is for stocks you might not hold onto long, TFSA is for long hold stocks but will still be taxed if not Canadian, and RRSP is for any market and won’t be taxed until traded but you can’t easily access.

Would greatly appreciate any critique on whether I’m making a big mistake with any of this or it sounds relatively safe? Or makes sense even? Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kzpmlu/would_anyone_care_to_let_me_know_if_what_i_plan/,1.0
stocks,1064046,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,kz682f,swaggymedia,1610889192,406,1,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

stocks,1062777,My portfolio for the next 10 years,kyvztf,dog34421,1610845966,21,2,"Here’s my current breakdown after recent rebalancing. I used to be 40% in clean energy etfs at the March lows and just sold alot of them. Ive been trading in and out of ICLN, QCLN and PBW since 2009. This is the 3rd multiyear swing trade I’ve been involved with them resulting in 100% or more gains. Right now i think alt energy needs a 30% drop to shake out alot of new late money coming from hype posts on reddit and elsewhere. All of a sudden everyone knows they’re a great bet after 300% up but very few here were saying buy them in March and NOBODY on CNBC was saying buy them at any time between March and now. Only last month have i been hearing CNBC heads talking about them. Great timing!
I know everyone here loves shit like VT but i don’t waste my time(or my opportunities) with it as i do not trade China/HK, India or Russia stocks and don’t want to invest directly in their entire market aside from the stocks from China that are in some of my etfs below like for example NIO is in a few of my etfs

I trade around a core position in all of these as they outperform i move money to underperformers every few weeks or months.

21% - EWC and BBCA - Canada - Canada has a 1.5% annual population growth rate. That is 3x the US rate of 0.5%. Nobody on CNBC talks about Canada or Australia which is my next biggest holding. They will all be hyping them eventually when they look for growth and “suddenly” realize theres 2 continent sized countries with stable governments and educated people rich in natural resources and rich in natural beauty with a currently small population with massive growth potential. They also have excellent immigration systems of bringing in people based on merit, education and skills required.
Canada in particular is gaining new previously mostly frozen land as the world warms. Endless amounts of land for actual humans to live on and  land with nat resources.

17% - EWA - Australia - also a 1.5% population growth rate that is scheduled to continue at that pace for the next 10 years at least.

Only downside to my Canada and Australia etfs is they are 33% financials which i hate but i like the rest of the sector weights they have and that weighting can change if their industrials and  tech cos become bigger just like financials in the SP500 became a way smaller % weight since 2008. 

22% - Technology etfs listed in order from biggest position to smallest. I believe alot of money will come out of bloated big tech like Facebook and at the same time big tech will continue to buy small tech cos. Facebook bought 80 companies in the last few years. When boomer morons on CNBC are saying sell tech to buy banks i know i should buy more tech. With tech to me valuations are often meaningless. You are investing in groups of smart brains/thinktanks. You are actually betting on 1 or more of them inventing a time machine( or other huge advancements) one day and that stock and any etf holding it opening the next day up INFINITE %. What will the banks invent? A better way to extract money from all of us as they get free fake newly printed money from the Federal Reserve? 
I also consider clean energy etfs to basically be tech but i will list them separately.

ARKK

PBW
FAN

4% - Europe 
DFE(great euro small cap mix)
EWU
GREK
EWP
FEZ
VGK
IEUR
EWD
ENOR

5% - Aerospace/Industrials, I’m proud to say i knew these were good holds(and SPCE) before Cathie Wood and Ark announced the Space etf. I will hold these going into that etf coming out and then move some of this money into the Space etf depending on the initial holdings they choose.
ITA
XAR
XLI
VIS
FTXR
IYT
PAVE

5% - mix of various etfs that i have been trading in and out of and increasing or decreasing how much i have in each based on performance. I shift money around them but always hold some of each long term. Some of these used to be a very large % of my portfolio but i recently rebalanced everything based on where we are now.

MJ - Cannabis, used to be 15% of my portfolio but now way smaller as i rode it up since March and sold most of it
XME/PICK - metals companies, also was 15% of my portfolio but with metals/materials making up 20% of EWA and 13% of EWC thats enough coverage for me.
JETS - airlines
HDV, SPYD, IDV - high divis
XLY - consumer discretionary, like it because its 21% Amazon and 18% TSLA
IYZ - telecom
ENZL - New Zealand
RYT, XLK - tech
IXJ - healthcare 
MOO - agriculture 
QQQE, QQQM
XLB, VAW, IYM - materials
ESGD, SUSL - esg 
Theres another 20 etfs i usually have in this list but don’t own right now like MTUM, SPHB, SKYY, WCLD, CLOU

&amp;#x200B;

* IPOD is a one that I believe will double, mainly because Chamath Palihapitiya is managing it and so far most of his have doubled when the merger is announced. Here is a link to read more: [https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/12/18899403/chamath-palihapitiyas-ipod-ipoe-ipof-spacs-what-investors-should-know](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/12/18899403/chamath-palihapitiyas-ipod-ipoe-ipof-spacs-what-investors-should-know)
* $ICLN I believe that with the new Administration in the US, this clean energy etf will perform very, very well. Pick up some commons, LEAPS (options expiring more than a year), or 6 months. Personally doing a LEAPS.
* $PFE vaccine news and earnings is still in the foreseeable future with the coronavirus. It is probably just getting started. Pfizer has pulled back and hitting support currently. Nice resistance trendline and currently hitting the 180 MA. Gaining some momentum on the MACD. I'd say get in now or closer to $36 and expect a run up to \~$40.
* $LI is a Chinese EV company. If you know me, I am passionate about the Chinese EV market. I lived in Shanghai for 10 years, and I have seen an exponential increase in the number of LI EVs on the streets. At first I didn't know what they were, but they looked nice; started seeing more and more and finally had to buy some of their stock. They are no secret anymore though. $LI consolidated some, so I picked up some $40 March calls. I'll be trimming the positions size at 25%, 50% and 100% profit.
* $AMD will hit $100 soon. It has done very well this year for my portfolio. My advice is buy some call options when/if it pulls back into the blue rectangle; personally I already bought some April $100 calls because I believe it is inevitable to reach that price target.

*Watchlist for tomorrow:*

* $JMIA is the Amazon of Africa. If this pulls back, I will buy some longer term call options.
* $ARKG and $ARKK I've been trying to get a good deal on these two. Both Cathie Woods. Both gold mines in my opinion. Strongly recommend holding these long term, and getting more exposure through options. Depending on your account balance you can do LEAPS, or debit spreads.
* $PLTR Cathie woods of Ark Invest started buying this one up. I will be watching for possible entries soon.
* $NNDM is another ARK baby that manufactures tech equipment based in Israel. Pick up when its on sale.

stocks,1050529,Did I invest too much in one lump sum?,kx8edi,learn-and-earn-,1610639964,77,2,"Hi there, r/stocks!  


A bit of a background: I'm a 27 year old, with a job that provides for my daily income. I recently ""woke up"" to realize that I need to invest the money that's just sitting idle in my bank account, especially since I do not need that much cash right now. So, I decided to invest some of my existing savings in the stock market for the **long term** (buy-and-hold, I'm in no hurry to make gains). This was my **first ever investment**, so I am quite the newbie. I'm hoping to invest a total of around $40,000-$50,000 this year.

Now, a few days ago, I bought stocks worth a total of around **$25,000**, largely in ETFs, **all together**. These are the investments:

1. MSFT: $4k (at around $214)
2. VGT: $4k (at around $353)
3. QQQ: $4k (at around $314)
4. ARKK: $3k (at around $139)
5. ARKF: $3k (at around $51)
6. PBW: $3k (at around $123)
7. ARKG: $2k (at around $106)
8. ICLN: $2k (at around $126)

I'm now having some second thoughts, and would be grateful to have some of your more qualified opinions on the same:

* Did I make a mistake by investing $25k altogether? I didn't know about DCA (dollar cost averaging) until after I finished buying (sounds stupid, and it is). The reason I'm nervous is because there are opinions that suggest the market is at an all-time high &amp; will pullback massively soon. OTOH, my portfolio looks ""balanced"" &amp; low-risk, but again, I'm not sure. To reiterate, I don't need the $25k cash &amp; am perfectly okay with investing it altogether, *if* the investments make sense.
* If this is a mistake, how can I fix it? Should I just sell off half my holdings, evenly across the board, and then DCA for the rest of the year?
* Or, should I keep the safer bets (MSFT, QQQ, VGT) and sell off just the riskier ones (ARK, PBW, ICLN)?
* Alternatively, should I just hold on, given that I'm here for the long-term?

stocks,1024347,What’s your experience with Trading212 ?,kt955z,Sweet-Zookeepergame,1610132483,12,1,"Hi all,

since I am in Europe (Germany) and can’t invest in the ARKK etf, I was looking for a way to recreate the ETF. My broker doesn’t have it and it‘s not accessible in Europe in general. Doing this manually will cost me too much money for every single transaction every single month (I want to invest monthly). Therefore I was looking for alternatives.

Found out that Trading212 has this amazing function called „Basked“. You can basically create your own basket with stocks ans adjust their weight. 7% Tesla, 6% Square, 5% Invitae etc. And you can automate the monthly investment rate and just set it and forget it. The fees are close to 0€ per transaction. Since I‘m putting just a little amount of money monthly, I‘m buying fractions of the shares every month. I couldn’t find any other broker who offers this.

Everything is perfect. They are based in the UK and Bulgaria (non-EU and EU).

My only concern is that Trading212 is still very young as a broker and don’t know how trustworthy it is going to be in the long run. For example, they don’t handle the taxes, compared to a traditional broker. You have to do it yourself, based on the country you live in, which could be tricky.

And also I don’t really know what would happen if they go bankrupt. I am supposed to be the beneficial owner of the shares I bought, but no idea how that‘d work with fractional shares. Or what will happen if they suddenly forbid them in Germany?

So, does anybody have experience with them? Would you recommend them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kt955z/whats_your_experience_with_trading212/,1.0

If I did that in my taxable brokerage account I’d have to pay short term capital gains tax. But I also have to pay capital gains tax on ARKK when I sell it.

So are they able to trade in and out of positions without paying capital gains since their shareholders will pay later? If that’s true then if I sell after holding for over a year do I still pay long term capital gains even though some of the profits were from short term trades?

Or are they also paying taxes on their trades and that’s somehow factored into the price of the ETF without double taxing their holders?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nxrynd/how_do_taxes_work_in_an_actively_managed_etf/,1.0

Im fairly new to investing (about a 7 months now). Ive been seeing the stock market reach new heights, and with the inflation and the amount of cash from the general public thats been put in stocks, i cant help but be worried about a crash. I own ARKK, PLTR, Crypto, and a bit of boring stuff like Coca Cola. But yet im hearing that there might be a small correction but a . boom is right around the corner as covid is coming near an end. So Im not sure who to believe. My thoughts were to sell more crypto and riskier tech stocks and put it either into Gold, S&amp;P,  or even holding more cash. But im not too sure as i still love the tech stocks im currently invested in. In a sense I could sell my majority and take a little profit i made and cash out and see what happens with the stock market. but then i would just have cash and with the inflation happening and more stimulus checks, im also worried my cash will just become worthless. 

I wanted to know what everyone thinks of the current market and if you had any advice for me.

I would like to present a more balanced and less charged view on hedge funds, shorting, naked shorting, synthetic shares and margin calls. There are quite a few misconceptions I would like to clear up as well. In addition a lot of the terms are often misused to control online narratives. I want to provide a bit of insight to help everyone out.

Here is a quick definition from Wikipedia:

“A hedge fund is a pooled investment fund that trades in relatively liquid assets and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading, portfolio-construction and risk management techniques in an attempt to improve performance, such as short selling, leverage, and derivatives.”

What that means is that a hedge fund is basically a pooled investment fund. Anyone trading on a margin account (that includes retail) can also short sell and use leverage.

So the only difference between a hedge fund and an actively managed fund like ARKK is that hedge funds use leverage and other strategies. 

A lot of people seem to have a disdain for all hedge funds. However, they are pooled funds. A pooled fund just means that the fund has been contributed to by more than one person. Not all hedge funds engage in abusive or shady tactics.

Hedge funds have individual members. People like you and me who are paying someone else to manage their money. Some people use them to save up for retirement. Especially if you have a lot of money, hedge funds can seem attractive because they can use more complex strategies which means that they have the potential to do well in various market conditions. Unlike an ETF which can crash along with the rest of the market.

Let’s take a look at what short selling or “shorting” is. Anyone with a margin account can short sell a stock. I will give the simplest explanation I can. 

You borrow a share at a variable rate. So the amount you owe for the share is always equal to the current market value of that share. If the cost goes up you owe more. If it goes down you owe less.

You then sell that share to someone for the value at the moment in time that you bought the share. Eventually, if the share price goes down, you can pay back your loan and pocket the difference.

So you borrow a share for $10, you sell it for $10. The share price goes down to $5. You now buy back the share for $5 and give back the $5 you borrowed to close the position. You have now earned $5.

That’s how the concept works. In practice your broker does that all for you.

Short selling is a way to make money on a stock that is losing value.

Now I’m going to give a simple explanation about what a margin call is. It seems like there’s been some confusion there.

When you borrow on margin, you can’t borrow 100% of your position. You have to have a certain percentage of your account in cash or similar assets. The specific percentage depends on the amount of risk you are taking.

If the ratio of your borrowed amount gets too high relative to the cash in the account, you get a margin call. You can either liquidate some of your holdings into cash or add more cash to the account or face consequences. The consequences are bad and can ruin your portfolio.

Short selling is the most common reason to get a margin call. If you borrowed shares and the share price goes up, the amount you owe goes up and you start to go into debt on the position. The more the share price goes up, the more likely it becomes that you will get a margin call.

There has also been a lot of talk lately about naked shorting. I’m going to give a quick explanation of that here. Naked shorting involves shorting a share that hasn’t yet been borrowed, along with the promise that the share will be found and borrowed within a set time period. Retail doesn’t have any way to do this as your broker will not open a position for you without first securing a share to borrow.

I believe the time period to secure a share is 3 days but don’t quote me on that. I’m retail so I’ve never had to worry about it.

So, basically, naked shorting means you sell someone a share which you haven’t borrowed yet and you promise the “system” that you will find a share to borrow later. It’s like if you owned a furniture store and you sold a customer an item you don’t have in stock with the promise you will have it delivered on Friday. It speeds up the transaction. If the share can’t be borrowed later the deal is cancelled and the transaction should be reversed.

I say “should” because I know there are some times when the shares don’t get secured or transactions are manipulated. Basically think of it as the furniture salesman making an empty promise that the furniture will come in the following week instead while trying to stop the customer from requesting a refund and frantically calling multiple suppliers to try to get the goods. It’s technically illegal but the SEC doesn’t aggressively enforce the rules. Or they are really hard to enforce because you can’t trace a transaction which hasn’t been completed or reported.

What is a synthetic share? It’s created by what happened in the above example. It’s a share “created” by naked shorting and then failing to secure a share to deliver. It’s illegal. But, again, the SEC doesn’t seem to go after it. Apparently it’s also much more common in Canada where there are loopholes and a lack of oversight which allow it to take place.

How does all of this affect a retail investor? 

The practice of legitimately short selling a share doesn’t have a direct impact on the retail investor. Retail investors can do it too. The problem is when short selling becomes abusive. For example, if there is a large organization which has short positions and also has financial or political power. Some firms will actively short a stock and then use their political and financial influence to damage the share price by changing public perception or in other ways. If they can pay the media to post an article painting a false picture of the company, leverage social media influence or even leverage politicians to somehow screw the company over, that’s where the problem is.

So short selling isn’t the problem directly. The problem is when a powerful firm or individual engages in market manipulation to make bank on their short positions. This is highly illegal but it’s also hard to prosecute as those types of cases take up time and money and are very likely to be thrown out of court as it’s often impossible to prove how any two things are connected without breaking the law during an investigation, an act which would invalidate the evidence.

Naked shorting and synthetic shares however do have a direct impact on the retail investor. Naked shorting by itself is fine as long as a share is secured in due time for the transaction. However, share prices are determined by supply and demand. When a synthetic share is created, it isn’t on the books. And a share can be kept synthetic forever if the person holding it isn’t in a rush to sell. So it can artificially boost the value of an account and keep the account holder satisfied.

If too many synthetic shares are created and “bought” it can lower the share price because it can hide some of the demand for the shares. It also allows certain organizations or individuals to purchase a large amount of shares without creating a spike in the share price. Normally when a large number of shares are bought it creates a spike in share price and can trigger an instant loss to the purchaser by those who hold shares closing their positions to quickly profit from the spike. This won’t happen with synthetic shares either so it’s an added motivation to secure synthetic shares instead of legitimate shares.

The problem with margin calls is that if someone is engaging in abusive short selling it adds fuel to the fire by pressuring them to step up their game. So the tactics being used to drive down the price of the shorted shares will become shadier or more aggressive. Another issue with margin calls is that they can cause a trickle down effect. If enough shares from other companies are sold to cover for margin calls the value of shares in those other companies goes down because it created an artificial selling spree. When large accounts are looking to liquidate they will usually liquidate lower performance stocks first which can hurt companies which were already underperforming and further reduce their share price.

So what does this all mean at the end of the day? This stuff has always been going on. It’s going to keep going on. The SEC isn’t very motivated to do anything about it because they make bank on the system existing much more than they do on giving out fines, enforcing regulations or spending money on legal fees.

It’s an unfortunate reality of the market. Unless there is drastic social change these things will keep happening.

But also keep in mind, not all short sellers are abusive, not all hedge funds resort to shady tactics, and some forms of naked shorting are legal.

I hope this helps people get a better understanding of buzz words and will also help them see that those same buzz words are often misused or taken out of proper context to control online narratives.

My personal opinion on this is that trying to stop this kind of activity in the market is just like trying to stop high school bullying. When you give bullies attention you just give them more power. Little people are always going to be little people. The best things you can do are to give them the silent treatment and shed light on how their tactics work so that other people are empowered to get a leg up on them by staying a step ahead of their game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/npfoaf/an_explanation_of_hedge_funds_shorting_naked/,1.0

stocks,2644224,30 years old. Here is my portfolio strategy - please criticize,nhzmj6,putsonbears,1621622345,61,1,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

I don’t see ARKK or EXPI going up to the amounts I bought it (pretty high) anytime soon. Selling those at a loss would free up some money to then reinvest into something like VOO. I know there isn’t a way to predict the market but I am trying to figure out if this is a smarter way to reallocate my funds. I could get some of the money back through taxes but could still lose a good sum.

stocks,2624293,Are high interest rates already priced in?,n9yaew,MalevolentPotato,1620743382,31,1,"
From my understanding inflation is a big concern with investors right now. People are worried this crazy inflation will not be transient, as insisted by the fed,  but instead will persist and force the fed to raise rates. But hasn’t the market already priced that in by now? Many many speculative/growth stocks have crashed over the past few months. High flyers like pltr, nio, QS, and arkk are 50-100% down from their recent highs. From my understanding cash flow 5 years out would be discounted by ~5% with a 1% increase in rates, but obviously we’re far past 5-10% drops. 

So then…

If interest rates really do start rising and Powell really does stop printing, how much worse can things get in the sectors that have already corrected? Is the raise in rates primarily going to affect the less speculative parts of the market if it comes? Growth companies are expected to trade at a premium to reflect some of their future earnings growth, are we still trading far above their fair value right now?

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&amp;P technology sector.
*****
&gt; The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
&gt; The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
&gt; “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
&gt; Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
&gt; The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
&gt; Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
&gt; # Tech battleground
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&amp;P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
&gt; Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
&gt; The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
&gt; Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&amp;P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&amp;P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
&gt; “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
&gt; “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
&gt; Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
&gt; “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

&gt; # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

&gt; After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&amp;P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

&gt; As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

&gt; While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

&gt; While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

&gt; # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

&gt; As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

&gt; To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

&gt; # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

&gt; Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

&gt; Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

&gt; Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

&gt; # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

&gt; One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

&gt; With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

&gt; Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

&gt; “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&amp;P 500 Index earnings growth.

&gt; So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

&gt; # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

&gt; The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

stocks,2615723,QQQ Research + Questions,n7l8u3,Vrozini,1620464855,12,1," I am very new to investing. I would like to try ETFs and am looking at the pros/cons of different ones starting with QQQ. Any advice or answers to questions is very much appreciated. 

**What is QQQ?**

Invesco QQQ is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market cap.

QQQ is the most direct way to “invest” into the Nasdaq-100 index as it tracks it and is passively managed. It is heavily based on technology. This seems like it can be a con as it is “less diverse” or a pro if you are bullish in tech. 

**Top 10 Allocation: (https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)**

**AAPL: 10.95%**

**MSFT: 9.50%**

**AMZN: 8.32%**

**TSLA: 4.24%**

**FB: 3.78%**

**GOOG: 3.62%**

**GOOGL: 3.31%**

**NVDA: 2.69%**

**PYPL: 2.31%**

**INTC: 2.11%**

**48.11% of total stocks are in the information technology sector.**

[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html)

It consistently outperforms it’s common comparison being the S&amp;P 500 Index.

A 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&amp;P 500 index. 

QQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&amp;P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&amp;P involves more mature companies.

Many people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don’t see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.

Personally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don’t know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found?

stocks,2614840,Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns,n7chm7,vgambhir,1620431535,110,1,"Recent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

When SPY first came on the scene in 1993, it was priced around $44 (from what I’ve researched). My question is, how did that number come to be?

I’ve been doing a bit of research into ETF pricing. I understand that ETF prices are determined by their daily NAV (unless I’m mistaken here), but how does the initial figure get decided on? Because an ETF float isn’t capped per se, I’m finding it hard to understand versus a regular stock.

As a sidebar, I’d also love to know how/if this is different to actively managed ETFs like ARKK, for example. How did they set their initial price of around $20 and how does the price get influenced day to day?

Current close price for today is $3.75 and I have an upside PT of $17 by end of July based on the below DD.

**$PBT - Permian Basin Royalty Trust**

Anyone familiar with Oil &amp; Gas US companies should be familiar with the Permian Basin which is where I have lived the past 35 years. It's one of the largest and most active O&amp;G royalty investments. Royalty trusts are a type of pass-through entity that is structured similarly to real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs). As long as they distribute a certain level of profits to unit holders as distributions, they avoid paying federal income tax.

**Shares 'Locked Up'(1031)**

Though there is no data on this, I believe a decent portion of shares are locked up by holders that utilize 1031 exchanges. Royalty Trusts that operate with mineral rights from land are used by corporations and businesses when they sell their real estate and oil leases to park capital through a 1031 exchange. This allows to defer tax on the sale of the real estate and utilize multiple exchanges in and out of the trust and into new real estate. $PBT has been a popular trust that many West Texas businesses use this for since you receive a decent dividend (prior COVID) along with well depreciation writeoffs. In fact it is so popular that the few attorneys in the area that do 1031 often recommend $PBT as the most attractive place for parking this capital if you don't already have a piece of real estate to move directly into after the sale of your current property. 1031 have timeline limitations and listing a royalty trust as an option gives the owner an option of exchange in case a deal falls through. This is extremely important for a short term squeeze in price since anyone in a 1031 on **$PBT** will not be selling their shares on any significant price increase because this capital is most likely allocated for a real estate buy under a corporate entity.

**$PBT** has been lagging behind other royalty trusts in the market due to a production holds on Oil Prices that could allow for it's dividend payment to grow exponentially. Below are some key factors outlined that help push the price:

**WTI Crude Oil Price outlook**

Oil prices have been on a run in early 2021 up until recently with new COVID scares slowing the explosive price action. However, most economies are still opening up faster than ever and vaccinations and summer months should help ease some of these worries. A recent article( [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Oil-To-Hit-80-On-Largest-Ever-Demand-Jump.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Oil-To-Hit-80-On-Largest-Ever-Demand-Jump.html)) has Goldman predicting Oil will reach $80 in the near future.

US imports plunge to lowest levels since 1973 from OPEC([https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Imports-From-OPEC-Plunge-To-Lowest-Since-1973.amp.html))

Current surplus of oil in reserve due to last year's lockdowns has shown a significant drawdown this year both in the federal strategic holdings and the EIA data published weekly. One thing to note is that the federal government allowed for a large amount of storage of oil under Trump that was trimmed significantly earlier this year as the companies bought back their oil and to put it back into the market. This is a key component since 18.3M barrels were already bought back last month and consumed by the market.

One mega oil producer in the Permian, Pioneer Resources, has also stated that pipelines are not at full capacity as operators are still working to bring on new wells and frac recent drilling. Pioneer has been super bullish, snatching up assets this past 3 months with the acquisition of Parsley Energy($7.6B) and Doublepoint($6.4B) , spending roughly $40,000 per acre for undeveloped land.

Royalty Trusts are they few true Oil plays related directly to Oil price and production since they carry little to no debt. Historically PBT stock price large increases in a short period are due to a spike in dividend that is related to the sale of Crude Oil on the market price. Since the price to produce the oil doesn't vary much, a higher price over a certain threshold always produces a much larger dividend.

**$PBT** dividend due to COVID has been one of the worst in the history of the 50 year old trust with a monthly payout of less than .01¢/share for the majority of 2020. March 2021 dividend was increased 57.9% from the prior month but still remains well below a typical month for the current Oil price. Below is a table that helps break down the yearly payout/unit and what short term monthly goals based on Crude Oils recent run in the market.

**PBT Production Outlook**

Based on my analysis, I believe **$PBT** has a production windfall coming into a supply squeeze in the coming months that will lead to an extremely large jump in dividend payouts and a large price increase if played correctly by investors. **$PBT** has one of the largest land holdings for a royalty trust at 78,715 gross (34,205 net) producing acres, roughly calculated based on recent lease acquisitions to a total value of $3.14B while trading on a market cap of $175M due to low dividend payout since COVID shutdowns and low production output.

[https://imgur.com/hKEhThS](https://imgur.com/hKEhThS)

**$PBT** royalties also went through a change as of April 1, 2020, Blackbeard Operating, LLC became the operator of record of the Waddell Ranch properties. Blackbeard has advised the Trustee that the total amount of capital expenditures for 2020 with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties totaled $10.4 million (gross). Under the new operator for 2020 there were 5 vertical drill wells started and 3 were completed, 2 new wells in progress and 5 workover wells in progress during the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to 0 workover wells completed, 0 new wells completed, 0 new wells in progress and 0 workover wells in progress for the three months ended September 30, 2019.

**PBT**’s current drilling activity compared to prior years when oil prices were suppressed due to overproduction in the US shows a high capacity ready to be turned on soon as oil reserves become more supply constrained. I do not believe that the supply issues will last for a long period and we will see a supply/demand similar to the 2008 or 2014 Oil boom of the Permian Basin when PBT was trading between $20-27/share compared to recent sub $4, leaving for a large capital upside short term swing of 5-7x return.

[https://imgur.com/qjyJu5J](https://imgur.com/qjyJu5J)

**Key reasons $PBT could 5-7x in the next few months include:**

* Lagging dividend due to current production
* Squeeze on WTI Oil prices due to reopening and lagging US production
* Institutional Investors(8.8%) and 1031 land holdings make up significant amount of float
* Low volume squeeze on a float of 46M cycling up price action
* Cheap call options chain 5-8months out

My Price Target for the month of June based on the above reasoning is $17 and a continued upside of $17-21 through August without any sort of volume manipulation or option squeeze.

Key things I wanted in my search:

* Small/mid cap
* Revenue/Debt transparency
* Current low float/Volume
* Stock price below $10
* Options chain available

I have based some of my findings for my PT on a related royalty trust $TPL that has had a run recently due to large oil production output but lower overall oil pricing during its run. $TPL went from $480-1710(2.5x) in the past 5 months off the same principles outlined for **$PBT**, except **$PBT** lagging in production coming online with higher oil prices leads me to believe a larger upside is possible.

**DISCLAIMER:** I do not have insider information and this is not financial advice. However I am privileged to more common information than the average retail investor for O&amp;G related companies. Running a family business in a tight-knit community like the Permian Basin for 16 years with customers like Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Frac Tech, OXY, XTO, Exxon, ConocoPhillips, and many more; I have insight into how active current companies operations in drilling, fracking, pumping, and other well related services. I also have a large family on both mine and my wife's side that work in Oil and Gas directly across many companies. The majority of my contacts are HR and Facilities Management, where I sold unrelated oil field products used or consumed by employees. We created our own custom CRM that allows me access to data that show the recent ramp up in new hires at many of these major companies and the products sold to each department that tell me what areas of O&amp;G are more active such as well service. I used this data to help me eliminate companies for my current O&amp;G investments due to worries of bankruptcy, but this data also helped me to cement in my belief that **$PBT** is the most pure Oil play available that's lagged the recent Oil related stock boom.

I don’t post much on Reddit but I am a very active member on discord in 2 large groups, United Traders and Unusual Whales under the username Broncho24. Those that know me are aware that I am usually a huge bear looking for cracks in over-extended companies and have been extremely successful in finding them, hence the call of ARKK in my last WSB post. Those that know me are also aware that I trade a large amount of Energy related companies because I understand them and with the recent Oil and Gas run since November I went hunting for trash to short.

**TLDR:** **$PBT** is currently a low volume mid cap pure mineral rights Oil play that isn't prone to bankruptcy. It has lagged the Oil market due to production output and Oil pricing leaving their dividend to be low. Current finished projects from 2020 when oil prices were suppressed should make the dividend pop and lead to a huge increase in volume that historically pushes the stock price up dramatically short term.

Investors are beginning to lose faith, analysts say, after stellar run in 2020",ozpprx,Abhisingh9916,1628325757,340,1,"A record 12 per cent of the ARKK exchange traded fund’s shares are being shorted by investors betting on a decline — a bet worth more than $2.7bn on August 3, according to S3 Partners, a specialist data provider. A year ago the tally stood at just $40m.

The rising scepticism, along with the emergence of a new ETF designed to take the opposite side of all Wood’s bets, reflects doubts in the tech-heavy strategy that worked so well for the ARKK fund as the markets bounced back from the shock of coronavirus lockdowns last year.

Some investors that have been waiting in 2021 for the fund to repeat its success in 2020 have lost faith and pulled out,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.

In 2020, the ARKK fund delivered returns for investors of nearly 150 per cent, helping to make it, and Wood, some of the biggest names in US fund management

Wood is known for bold bets and striking pronouncements on what she sees as rosy prospects for assets, including electric carmaker Tesla shares.

In the opening months of this year, betting against the ARKK fund was painful; short sellers were down $38m in mark-to-market losses, or 2.26 per cent, from January to June, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. But a sharp reversal in their fortunes now means ARKK shorts are up $137m, or 7.8 per cent, so far this year.

“With the ARKK short trade becoming profitable, we saw $369m of additional short selling over the last 30 days,” Dusaniwsky said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ozpprx/bets_against_cathie_woods_flagship_etf_hit_record/,1.0

stocks,2907431,Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon,onbaw5,abdul10000,1626690265,343,1,"I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).

&amp;#x200B;

Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.

&amp;#x200B;

The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent? 

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year. 

Let's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.

&amp;#x200B;

We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\^2 + $500/(1.01)\^3 = $780

&amp;#x200B;

But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?

&amp;#x200B;

Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\^2 + $500/(1.02)\^3 = $761

&amp;#x200B;

The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit forums always scream, ""don't fight the FED,"" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be. 

This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\_beware\_arkk\_is\_a\_liquidity\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.

# **Stocks face another turbulent week as the third quarter winds down - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/stocks-face-another-turbulent-week-as-the-third-quarter-winds-down.html)**
*****
&gt; After recent turbulence, markets are likely to close out the final week of the third quarter with another bout of volatility.
*****
&gt; Stocks posted big moves in the past week. First, fears of financial contagion coming from Chinese developer Evergrande sent stocks skidding Monday. Those losses were reversed by Thursday, when the market ripped higher. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were positive for the week, while the Nasdaq was flat.
*****
&gt; “I think this market turmoil has yet to conclude,” CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said. “Certainly September is doing what it normally does. It frustrates investors.”
*****
&gt; The three major stock indexes are also higher for the third quarter.
*****
&gt; Strategists say how the market trades in the coming week may be the most important development, after the wild swings in stocks and also the rapid rise in Treasury yields late in the week. The 10-year rate had shot up to 1.46% by Friday after trading at about 1.31% on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/cw3qZgY.png
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for September.
*****
&gt; “We are getting long in the tooth. The technical indicators are pointing to distribution. We’re seeing prices roll over, breadth roll over. You’re seeing sentiment roll over,” Stovall said, noting the market’s breadth needs to improve, and many stocks are trading below their 200-day moving average.
*****
&gt; # October is a ‘seismic’ month
“I think October will be true to itself, which is a very volatile month. October’s volatility is 36% higher than the average of the other 11 months of the year,” Stovall added. “Volatility is higher and you have a greater number of pullbacks, corrections and bear markets that either start or end in the month. It is a seismic month.”
*****
&gt; Wealth management firm Wellington Shields warns that the fact many stocks have fallen below their 200-day moving average is a negative for the market. Just 59% of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange remain above it, or in an uptrend, according to the firm. The 200-day moving average is the average of the last 200 closing prices of a stock or index, and it’s viewed as a momentum indicator.
*****
&gt; “The rule is that when this 200-day number drops from above 80% to below 60%, it usually goes below 30%. Forgetting that, the real point is that while most stocks may be advancing, barely more than half are advancing enough to be in uptrends. With the market just a few percent below its highs, this is a concern,” Wellington said in a note.
*****
&gt; # What to watch
In the coming week, there are a few key economic reports including including durable goods Monday and ISM manufacturing Friday. There is also personal consumption expenditure data Friday, which the Federal Reserve monitors for its inflation index.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will remain a big focus in the week ahead. There will be a host of Fed speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who testifies twice before Congress on the pandemic and the policy response to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will join him for the hearings Tuesday and Thursday. Powell also appears on a European Central Bank panel with other central bank leaders Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching Congress in the week ahead, as lawmakers attempts to pass a funding plan in time to avert a government shutdown Oct. 1. The debt ceiling is expected to be part of that debate, but strategists do not expect it to be resolved at the same time. They say this could hang over the markets for several weeks before Congress raises the debt ceiling.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers are not expected to provide any new information, but they could fine tune their message after the central bank signaled this past Wednesday that it expects to begin paring down its $120 billion in in monthly bond purchases soon. The Fed also released a new forecast for interest rates, which revealed that half of the 18 Fed officials expect to raise interest rates next year.
*****
&gt; “I think what the Fed’s achieved so far is a taper without a tantrum,” Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist Marc Chandler said.
*****
&gt; “I think a lot of people who invest in the market have a sense they are skating on thin ice, and any crack could be a big one. ... People are highly sensitive and nervous because they know valuations are stretched,” he said. “That means we should expect these episodic jumps in volatility.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said the market will need to digest the recent moves, particularly the move higher in Treasury yields.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/04o6okR.png
*****
&gt; “What we’ve got to wait for now is finding this new equilibrium. What kind of market should we expect? Trending? Or do we try to find a range?” he said. “I think we find a range. We need some hurdles to pass.” Chandler added that one hurdle is the September jobs report on Oct. 8.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to taper its $120 billion monthly bond purchases unless there is shockingly weak employment data. “That is the only thing that stands in the way of Fed tapering,” Chandler said.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said the quarter end could be quiet in terms of big funds rebalancing. “The equity market bounced around. It’s up on the quarter. That wasn’t much when you compare it to the bond performance,” he said.
*****
&gt; The 10-year yield made an unusually volatile round trip move in the third quarter. It was 1.47% on June 30, and it was as high as 1.46% on Friday. In between, it dipped to 1.12% in early August. Schumacher said the bond market could be quieter ahead of the quarter end, and the 10-year yield could then resume its move higher.
*****
&gt; Some strategists watch the 10-year Treasury yield as a leading indicator for stocks. It is also linked to moves in technology and other high-growth stocks.
*****
&gt;  # What’s next
Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton said high growth and tech are susceptible now to moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. She said the technology sector is the most overbought in relative terms, when comparing the sector to the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P 500 tech sector was up nearly 1% for the week, and it was up nearly 6% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; ""We would consider reducing exposure to growthy ETFs like ARKK and would be respectful of any breakdowns,” Stockton said.
*****
&gt; Investors have been fixated on the S&amp;P 500′s 50-day moving average, which sat at 4,439 on Friday. For the first time this year, the index broke below and closed under the average for multiple sessions this past week. By Thursday, it regained the 50-day and finished above it. The broad-market index closed above the 50-day moving average on Friday, at 4,455.
*****
&gt; The 50-day is literally the average of the last 50 closing prices, and it is viewed as an important momentum indicator, just as the 200-day moving average is. A break above could signal a positive move, and a break below it could mean more downside.
*****
&gt; Stockton said the relief rally in the S&amp;P 500 could resume in the coming week. “But we think it will fade by the end of the week given the downturns in our intermediate-term indicators. We expect the SPX to make a lower high,” she wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; She expects the 10-year Treasury yield could continue higher. “Momentum appears to be shifting to the upside and next resistance is near 1.53%. The breakout should benefit the financial sector, which saw significant outperformance [Thursday],” Stockton noted.

&gt; # September Seasonality Update

&gt; Well. Seasonality is back. Everyone in the financial media has been talking about September seasonal weakness lately. And here we are in September and the market has sold off the 5% or so we projected last month. And it did so in the notoriously treacherous week after September quarterly options and futures expiration.

&gt; Then as expected traders and fund managers bought the 5% dip as they have throughout this bull market rally with the blessing of the Federal Reserve’s continuing dovish tone and accommodative policy that they reinforced at the conclusion of yesterday’s FOMC meeting.

&gt; We do not expect stocks to succumb to the October curse this year. That doesn’t rule out some downside disturbance, but we do not foresee an impending crash, massacre or big selloff of the sort that have given October it’s dubious reputation as the jinx month.

&gt; Many of the same geopolitical, political, fundamental and technical headwinds we highlighted last month remain, as well as some others, so another 5% or so pullback is quite likely as Wall Street still may suffer from chronic “Octoberphobia.”

&gt; We’ve been doing this for decades and this pullback was prototypical end of Q3 window dressing and institutional selling. Several factors weighed on the markets, but most had been there all year. So why did the market selling off this month? Seasonality.

&gt; # Individual Investor Sentiment Bounces Back

&gt; Last week saw a massive decline in optimism according to the AAII's weekly investor sentiment survey. In fact, bullish sentiment saw its largest one-week decline in over two years. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has technically declined more in the week leading up to this week's survey than last week's, sentiment actually improved with the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish rising from 22.4% to 29.9%. That was the biggest one-week increase since the first week of July, but the percentage of bullish respondents is still well below the past year's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Even though there was a big pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment was only little changed. This reading only fell 0.1 percentage points to 39.3%. That remains at a level above anything observed since last fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That means that mostly all of the gains to bullish sentiment this week borrowed heavily from the neutral camp. Neutral sentiment fell sharply this week shedding 7.4 percentage points. That was the biggest one-week decline since a 7.5 percentage point drop in the first week of August.

&gt; We'd also note that while last week saw a big shift in sentiment among individual investors, this week, newsletter writers followed suit as bullish sentiment among that group fell below 50% to 47.1% for the lowest reading since May. Bearish sentiment meanwhile rose to 22.3% which is the highest reading since October 7th of last year.

stocks,3051166,Just rolled over my 401K to IRA. Critique my plan.,pqocek,Harambe_Like_Baby,1631978420,16,1,"33 years old. I just rolled over my 401K to traditional and Roth IRAs and am starting with a clean slate. I plan to use the Roth, which is about two-thirds of my balance, for growthier type investments. Regardless, I want to allocate to a few ETFs (maybe a couple of stocks) and sort of set it and forget it. I'd rebalance/trade maybe a couple of times a quarter. I have high risk tolerance and 0 interest in fixed income for the foreseeable future.

I'm thinking traditional gets split evenly between VOO and QQQM.

For Roth, one-third to QQQJ, one-third to IWN, and the last third for more speculative thematic type ETFs.  QQQJ is a next gen tech ETF recently launched at the same time as QQQM - it's essentially a less dumb version of ARKK. IWN is small cap value.

We currently have an investment portfolio worth just shy of 50k. It’s about 20% ETFs (mostly SPY, VT, ARKK), 70% stocks (50/50 split of boomer stocks and risky growth stocks), and maybe 10% options (some of which being covered calls on our larger shares of growth stocks).

We own some real estate as well, and I’m hoping to use this 50k in cash to really diversify our portfolio. I’m concerned that I’m heavily tech/growth leveraged right now and that the market is on an insane bull-run with an inevitable sell-off in the future.

stocks,3416357,Few ideas on why Burry bought LMT and how to invest in 2022,rnm4sh,FiboPI,1640351727,1,1,"Hello world

Few months ago I wrote a bearish post about ARKK investments and how green energy will be demolished. Turns out I was right or lucky, one of those. As an investor I am looking not only for fundamentals in companies, but products and political situation. 

We all know that Dr. Burry is bearish for a few years now. He is predicting a crash monthly, shorted TSLA many times and is dancing with his Twitter account like a mad man (for those of you who don't know, he deletes his account multiple times in a month, as well as his posts). 

In my view his selling is nothing of a surprise. He is doing what he is saying - most of the market up so he sells. But why did he buy $LMT? A military company that relies heavy on government contracts? Why is he bearish on China?

Well this is one of the biggest political questions of this decade. What is going to happen to Taiwan?

Turns out Burry believes there will be a military conflict. He doesn't say it out loud because it would make news and probably impact his image, but his investment in military entity regardless of current market conditions suggest he is preparing for escalation of conflict. 

As investors we should take stances with our money. For example in my case I believe there will be no military interaction between US and China thus I am a buyer of Chinese indexes right now. 

And this is what I think is going to happen next year and what I personally think is the safest way of proceeding with stocks. 

As a fundamental investor my approach to buying companies is simple - in Buffet words I ""own them like pieces of businesses"". I try to keep my investments for a long time and buy them as I would be buying a piece of a local bakery. 

I am not a bear and not a bull. I simply buy what's worth buying in my circle of competence. 

Turns out most of the bakeries around town are not producing enough bread to justify quotes for their businesses. 

But we won't face a big correction or a crash. 

Why? 

Because I believe we are in two stock markets right now. 

There is market of reason where we might find stocks with strong fundamentals, earnings growth and P/Es under 25, and P/Bs under 5. There are active investors in this buckets, they buy and sell using their knowledge and fundamentals. It's really really hard to do. 

There is a second market of pure speculation and extremeness. Meme stocks, bubbled up car companies etc. etc. This market will function as long as people won't pull the rug. 

The only questions how much impact one market has over the other. There won't be a 30% decline in the market of reason. But individual stocks can and will decline 30% and more. For example NVIDIA is a great company we can all agree, metaverse is a big topic right now but the company lost it's fundamentals because of the ever growing bullish public. As Buffet said ""a great company can be a terrible stock investment"". Beware of companies like that in 2022. For example I would love to buy McDonalds stock. But I can't. Valuation of my favourite fast food joint is getting more and more crazy and I can't stomach the valuation right now. Declining earnings, ever growing PE and stock price...I am a buyer for sure but not now, if the market drops 15-20% McDonalds would need to increase earnings and growth to make my loss back without even thinking of making a buck in this company right now.

S&amp;P might fall 10-15-20%. Maybe it won't. But the question we all should ask ourselves ""how quickly my holdings can recover?"" Are the companies that you hold have enough cash flow to survive? Are they burdened with debt? Or they have healthy balance sheets and decline of 10% is only a buying opportunity? 

McDonalds won't be able to recover quickly and will be a buying opportunity if the market decides to bring it back to fundamental valuations.

Stock market will weigh all of these things next year and the following years as well. 

If you hold a company or a meme stock without cash flow, without real earnings and without real money customer to company, hard cash, you might hold your bags forever. 

I am incredibly interested what 2022 will bring us, I wish you all the best and good luck with your investments.

The Fed has announced yesterday at the FOMC that they will accelerate tapering and consider three fed funds rate hikes in 2022, from a rate of almost 0.08% (right now) to about 1.00%. 

Due to the increasingly less liquidity in the market throughout 2022, would it be wise right now to start shorting pre-revenue or negative-revenue companies?

&amp;#x200B;

\- $AMTX: outright fraud I think. A credible short seller reports on this. 

\- $PLUG: This one is easy. They are trading at a market cap above their TAM and about 20X their projected sales in 2024. 

\- $PCT: highly speculative, some suggest outright fraud 

\- $PLL: They trade as if they are already producing, while in fact they are waiting for 2 permits that they may or might not get. They got hyped up about a deal with TSLA with has become obsolete after missing deadlines. 

\- $BLNK: EV play with low quality products, high competition, and profitability not before 2023 if at all. 

\- $TSP: Similar story. A short seller sees outright deception and I agree with 50% with what they said. 

\-$DNA: Allegations of fraud, related party revenue mostly, SEC investigations, ,,, 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to more respectable namesL 

\- $NET: Highly overvalued

\- $SNOW: GREAT company, still overvalued at PS\~100. 

\- $COIN: Competition issues, speculative by nature since coins are. 

\- $ARKK: basket of high bets on overvalued growth stocks. They are digging themselves in a ditch by selling higher quality names to buy their beaten down stocks. Risks are more and more concentrated.     

&amp;#x200B;

My list s longer but these names stand out. And among the respectable megacap I think $NVDA is due for a major correction due to only valuation issues.

stocks,3359703,Cathie Wood to Launch a New ETF. It Tracks a Transparency Index,rb5cmz,EricTheAce,1638901070,332,104," 

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management is revving up to launch its second new U.S. exchange-traded fund in almost three years this week.

The ARK Transparency ETF follows the Transparency Index (TRANSPCY), which tracks the stock price movements of the 100 most transparent companies globally. It is ARK's ninth ETF, and begins trading Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

""ARK believes transparent companies have less friction which could lead to exponential growth opportunities,"" the company wrote in an investment factsheet.

The Transparency Index's top five holdings as of Oct. 31 include Cloudflare ( NET) , Bloom Energy (BE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) , Tesla ( TSLA) and Spotify ( SPOT) , according to ARK.

Wood became a high-profile manager after her innovation-focused portfolios surged in 2020, with the investment firm's flagship ETF, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), delivering a 153% return that year. She became especially well-known for her bullish call on Tesla -- a call she has since reiterated, saying she believed the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.

The investment products have since struggled to outpace last year's gains, trading mostly sideways in 2021. The Innovation ETF is down nearly 25% this year, and the worst performer -- the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) -- down 31%.

Only two of ARK's ETFs have risen year-to-date -- the Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL) and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ).

Just like most ppl on this sub back in 2020 I was a big ARK bull, but after seeing how they've performing since Feb '21, I've sold off all my ARK funds.

Stocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department’s November jobs report. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%
* VIX: +8.71%
* NVIDIA: -4.46%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%
* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%
* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%
* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%

Development surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market’s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen “a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility” of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. 

Vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

Moreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department’s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers

* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected
* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October

Jim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said “The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage."" 

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory."" 

On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. 
* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I’m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I’m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. 
* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren’t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company
* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. 
* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. 
* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. 
* Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. 
* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  
* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.

A few months ago, they released a Tesla valuation model that can be found on their github [here](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model).  I don't care to comment on the assumptions of their business -- as 2025 hasn't yet come, it would just be my word against ARKs.  There is, however, an interesting assumption at the bottom of their Tesla valuation that I *do* want to talk about.  They assume shares outstanding will increase from 960M at the end of Q4 2020 to 964M in 2025.  This is integral to their per share price target.  

Let's check how Arkk is doing on that assumption.  In terms of financial quarters, we're 10% of the way to the end of 2025, Tesla should be around 960.4M shares.  According to [Tesla's most recent 10-Q, pg. 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000524/tsla-20210630.htm), there are 990M shares outstanding as of July 22.  That's 7x the shares ARK assumed in 10% of the time.  But Tesla hasn't issued any new shares, so what exactly is going on here?  

The answer lies in the diluted share count.  Diluted share count includes all sources of additional shares that could be converted or exercised, e.g. convertible bonds, Employee stock options, warrants, etc.  These instruments are exercised over time, and the basic share count will tend towards the diluted count.  On pg. 13 of the 10-Q, we can see that including dilutive effects, Tesla's share count is closer to 1.12B.    

The utility of the diluted share count should be obvious.  If one is modeling a security five years out, especially if the projected price movement is bullish, it should be assumed that all outstanding stock options, warrants and convertibles will be exercised and added to the share count to create an accurate price target.  20% of Tesla's outstanding dilutive instruments have been exercised in the last six months.  Diluted share counts tend to catch up quickly.  

Why would companies dilute their shares like this?  Employee stock options can pad cashflow and convertible bonds' optionality can decrease interest coupon rates.  These are highly desirable among growth companies with poor cashflow and low/nonexistent credit ratings.  Tesla suffered from both of these problems for many years.
  
Which brings us back to ARK.  ARK largely deals in early stage startups and growth companies.  They should see a lot of these instruments being used.  They should be intimately familiar with the effects of SBC, convertibles, and warrants.  Yet, they didn't consider these effects in their last two models.  This leads to three possible conclusions:  
1) No one at ARK realized the model was made using the basic share count.  
2) ARK intentionally used the basic share count to increase their price target.
3) ARK's security analysts don't know the importance of using a diluted share count in this situation.  

None of these options paint a particularly rosy picture of the firm.  If you invest in ARK, this is the quality of research being used to make investing decisions.  Caveat Emptor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pe5av4/tesla_diluted_share_count_and_ark_research/,1.0

The [major cannabis ETFs trailing the S&amp;P 500](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4BCPI.png), and what's worse these funds are down 40% or more from their February highs. These funds have expense ratios of around 0.75% and experience significantly greater volatility in return for this underperformance. MSOS is positive, yet trailing the S&amp;P since inception while the others have lifetime negative returns.

Individual cannabis stocks tell a similar story. While a few are up this year, these show the performance characteristics of a pump and dump and are currently down over 80% from their February highs. Others are down double-digits YTD while the broader market is up significantly. 

A case can be made that these stocks are experiencing the same pressure that high-multiple growth sectors like ARKK are experiencing, yet there's one major difference there: ARKK actually did well last year. The broader history of cannabis stocks goes from bad to abysmal. The longer-lived of these stocks - have [negative returns over multiple years](https://i.imgur.com/7DObkKc.png).

These stocks further show a pattern of [rapidly](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TLRY/tilray/shares-outstanding) [expanding](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CGC/canopy-growth/shares-outstanding?q=)  [share counts](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ACB/aurora-cannabis/shares-outstanding) with high dilution to drive down individual share prices. IMO, these stocks are preying on young, primarily-male retail investors by coupling social media campaigns with repated share offerings. None of them are profitable, nor expected to become profitable anytime soon and instead seem to trade on the promise of capitalizing on the broader legalization trend without real evidence that these companies will be the ones actually capitalizing on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p7s91j/cannabis_etfs_trailing_the_broader_market_this/,1.0

I don't see any recent posts on $BETZ and want to lay out the bull and bear case for discussion.

In case you don't know, $BETZ is a Sports Betting ETF offered by Roundhill Investments and can be purchased at all your good providers [here](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/betz/#buy-nerd-section). They are exposed to in-person sportsbooks, online gaming and data infrastructure companies.

* Market Cap: 2.2bn
* Number of Holdings: 42
* ROI since inception: +98%

So far so, so good. Solid returns in a year and they do claim there were extraordinary market conditions but can we climb another 50% in another years time?

[https://i.imgur.com/NSStoyP.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/NSStoyP.jpeg)

And how about their holdings?

* The Score - 5% - 19m
* RSI - 4.76% - 19m
* Flutter - 4.59% - 18m
* Draftkings - 4.45% 17m
* Golden Nugget, Entain, Pointsbet, Kindred, Penn, Betmakers, 888, Tabcorp, Betsson, Genius Sports, Playtech, Evolution, Scientific Games descending down a million or so at a time.

This portfolio is nicely diversified but has some gamble upside on The Score (just bought by PENN), RSI at a greater % than Flutter and DKNG as well as some non-sports specialists such as Evolution, Scientific Games and Tabcorp - an Australian sportsbook and even providers such as Genius Sports and Kambi. If you were going to build an ETF to survive the downtimes and excel in the good times, this is it. BETZ is only exposed to the US for 37% with Malta being next highest at 12.5%. Large cap exposure is only 45% which is much lower than some of the big ETFs such as Arkk.

According to the market opportunity [here](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/assets/pdfs/BETZ_ETF_Investor_Deck.pdf), the global market could be as high as $95bn in 2023. This particular statistic is misleading because it doesn't say what that means for the fund. Draftkings are trading at a 20X revenue multiple, so you could say the market is potentially worth 1.9 trillion in stock valuation, but where does that get us? I guess the idea is that by 2023, within 2 years, the TAM will have increased by 50% and so will BETZ.

Finally, let's talk about timing and momentum. Covid shut down in-person gambling and forced states to open up for tax revenue. But here's the thing - they didn't open any where as quickly as was thought. If NY, Florida, Texas and later California legalize, it really could increase 50% and that's just in the US.

stocks,3250520,Some criticism on Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs,qsguu7,dazzc,1636739888,29,1,"So this is bit of a brief reflection on 'ARK' ETFs managed by the famous Cathie Wood, and how they compare to the common market index funds, as well as some individual stock tickers not within the ETFs in the past year.

Some brief background: I've been told and read many times that actively managed portfolios are often outperformed by the overall market ETFs/Index funds over time, so the latter is the better play. For a safer play I put aside part of my portfolio into an ARK ETF, specifically the Genomic Revolution - ticker: ARKG (since I work and have faith in the Healthcare sector).

Well, looking a year in the past how would you assume an ETF performed in one of the biggest bull markets +20%? a conservative +10%??

In actual fact, the ARKG fund is &gt;!down -0.38%!&lt; from a year ago. And if you think this is a one off, then you'd be mostly right - the ARKK (Innovation ETF) is &gt;!up +18.26%!&lt;, ARKF Fintech is &gt;!up +21.30%!&lt;, and ARKW Next Gen Internet ETF is &gt;!up +30.78%!&lt;.

Decent right? Except when you start comparing to the overall markets, for example: S&amp;P500 is &gt;!up +31.56%!&lt; and NASDAQ QQQ is &gt;!up +35.79%!&lt;.

So what's the point? Two main takeaways:

**1).** I've realised that market tracking funds are generally better, even compared (most of the time) to specific industry/sector ETFs.

**2).** The active management in the holdings of the ARKG ETF is especially questionable, and think people should understand stock holdings and respective weighting before blindly picking an ETF just because of a famous name (like I did). There are plenty of tickers not in the holding that are far better plays (such as DXCM, AUPH, BCRX, ME, and others I can't mention) that have no holding at all.

stocks,3171399,Inflationary Depression (Part 3): Time to Make Money,qgyo4o,captnamurica2,1635346847,15,1," Taking what I have written in Parts 1 and 2 (These can be found on my profile or the BurryEdge Subreddit), I think we have enough information to figure out how to make strategic bets to protect ourselves from the impending increased inflation and the governments response to the inflation.

**The Economic Environment**

Interest rates have bottomed, as was explained in Part 1 and Part 2. We have put more Government money into the economy than any other time and we have increased M2 more than any other time in history.

Well, in response we have gotten an economy that cannot handle the amount of demand that it has produced. The output gap produced (as was discussed in Part 2) has resulted in shortages across the board. This has given us inflation that the government had not prepared for (who could have predicted all this government spending would lead to inflation). Consumers are picking up steam with the latest data showing a huge increase in houses bought, consumer confidence increasing, delivery times picking up, input price increases and working demanding more pay (If your subreddit does not allow pictures I would check out Part 3 on the BurryEdge subreddit so you can see the charts I have posted, I find them to be extremely important).

As you can see shortages are causing huge increases in delivery times and prices (with core inflation skyrocketing an important tool to try to predict what the Fed will do). Now how can we tell this is a fiscal stimulus problem? Because the US is the only one experiencing problems on the scale we are seeing here in the United States and the United States were the only ones to stimulate the economy in the extreme fashion that we did.

With basically every consumer goods company reporting shortages with insane demand which is coupled with the great resignation (discussed in Part 2) we have workers working in overdrive while not having wages that are keeping up with inflation. This has caused strikes across the board in what media is calling “striketober” as workers demand better conditions and more pay (this is extremely important). This *could* be the start of an unanchoring inflationary event known as the wage cost spiral. This is when workers expect more money to make up for their losses from inflation, this leads to higher input costs, which leads to higher output prices/higher inflation. This creates a feedback loop that can cause inflation to become unanchored in a negative manner. This is something we must keep a close look on. I believe if the John Deere strike results in success and they get higher pay, we could see more workers take notice and request higher pay across the country (I believe that strike specifically is the most important to pay attention to).

Now where are we seeing shortages and increased expenses? Well basically everywhere, from semiconductors, to food, to fertilizer, to precious metals (such as magnesium, steel, aluminum), commodities (coal, natural gas, oil), coffee, housing, paper pulp (Paper is up roughly 50% from last year and experts expect another toilet paper shortage along with books), Lumber/Wood again, HVAC systems, Chicken, and the list just keeps going.

**Why this isn’t transitory and could become dangerous**

Well, we just need to wait on the pandemic right, this is just supply chain kinks, right? Wrong, if you look at the above charts, Charts 1 and 2, you will see where the supply kinks fixed themselves around March. What we are seeing is demand driven shortages due to an economy operating at a pace that it literally cannot handle especially with a drop in potential GDP (Part 2). This demand is now hitting us due to pent up savings (discussed in part 1 and part 2), and the previously discussed fiscal stimulation (Part 1 and 2), and Covid coming to an end in the eyes of consumers. This is also the first Covid free Holiday season being celebrated by most Americans in almost 2 years. We are seeing shortages pick up in September/October because consumers are worried about inflation/shortages and are starting to pick up the inflationary mindset (Part 2), another possibly dangerous unanchoring event that we must pay attention to. So how do we make money on this? (I know you’re just thinking “Finally!!!!”)

**The United States Treasury Bond**

As discussed in Part 1and Part 2, the US has been increasing M2 at a breakneck pace and the economy has gotten near levels that the Fed will consider “tapering” or the reduction of Quantitative Easing (Part 1). What this means is that the money supply will stop growing as fast, as the government stops buying bonds to flush markets with cash (that’s basically all QE is). Now, for those of you who do not know, there is a correlation between treasury bond prices and treasury bond yields. They work inverse so when bond prices go up, bond yields go down and vice versa. Well, when the Fed begins to reduce its bond buying this will cause bond prices to go down as result to a reduction in demand. When the prices of bonds go down yields go up (This will be discussed more in another paragraph). This causes a double effect of not only decreasing the money supply by reducing bond buying, but it also causes a decrease in the money supply by increasing rates. And based on our core inflation readings from earlier with the shortages getting worse, I think it is safe to say that tapering will begin on November 2nd. This is why the 60-40 rule of stocks to bonds is now longer good risk management because stocks and bond now move

Currently private investors are not buying treasuries, and neither are banks (as of recently). The only large buyer of bonds currently is the Federal Reserve meaning that there is no demand at current levels if the Fed stops buying, leading to a reduction in bond prices. This is where we will begin the thesis for our short on 20 year treasury shortages in the form of the $TLT ETF. As tapering decreases we will see TLT increase to the long term inflation expectation rate of roughly 3% (this will increase as inflation increases of course, this expectation can easily change with inflation fears). Current 20 year bond rates are at about 1.7% today, which means we can expect at a minimum, an increase of about 1% in 20 year bond yields when tapering begins to reduce. A 1% change in bond yields leads to about an 18%-20% decrease of TLT (Remember this is the minimum amount it will drop from just tapering).

As investor fears about inflation picks up, this could cause rates to increase faster, as less investors want bonds so they demand a higher yield. This also does not take into account the Federal Reserve moving up its timetable for a federal fund rate hike which would lead to a money crunch and a further increase in bond yields as demand reduces. So a short on TLT is one investment I think is a good move since I see a minimum drop of roughly 20% (or a buy on TBT which just works as inverse). These are 2 vehicles I would look into for investing against inflation.

This could’ve had more detail but I think it gets the point across, if you have questions please comment below.

**An Asset Crunch**

As I said before, stocks and bonds have moved in tandem in recent years. This new correlation is why you should also begin to short stocks. Well first let’s discuss why they move in tandem. It’s because the yield of a treasury bond is the discount rate used by the market. If there is confidence in the dollar/Fed, then companies will use this as their discount rate. So, when interest rates increase, the value of all stocks decrease due to this discount rate, it also acts as a money crunch since less money would be borrowed. Also tapering is decreasing as well, which has the double effect of increasing rates and reducing the money supply. So obviously this would *normally* only cause a small effect on stocks, unless they are in a bubble (or overleveraged). As we learned in Part 1, stocks and houses, are in a bubble. Now why would stocks in a bubble be a larger cause to worry. Well stocks in a bubble, act as a Ponzi Scheme. Now bear with me for a moment while I explain. A bubble is when an asset ignores its underlying intrinsic value and people simply invest in it because *someone else will invest in it leading the asset price to increase*. A bubble implies that individuals aren’t paying attention to the business, they are expecting to make a return based on the ***sole reason*** that someone else will want to buy the stock, not anything to do with the underlying business. Now when the money supply decreases or the discount rate increases, there is no next man up to pay for the asset. As with a ponzi scheme, when there are no more buyers everyone begins dumping their shares because it is now impossible for the asset price to keep growing and if something isn’t growing (especially in an inflationary environment) this will lead to a total collapse of the price until it becomes something worth of value.

This doesn’t include price pressures put on by shortages or the volatility that can be created by options. I suggest anyone who is reading this to read the thread by @ thelastbearsta1 on twitter regarding volatility. This explains why an asset crash will not be as long as the bubble burst in ’99 but will be a sudden and flash crash among stocks in a bubble (along with the fact that option buying is at all time high levels, possibly causing reverse gamma squeezes). My personal choices for these “bubble stocks” are Tesla (if you’re about to argue with me on this, think about the fact that Tesla went up 100 billion on a 4 billion revenue, not profit, contract, and also I have other choices here if you disagree with my thought process on Tesla), almost any EV company, Roku (this is one of my favorites), new tech IPO’s, ARKK fund (Basically the biggest bubbles that are expecting more growth, that higher interest rates won’t allow), some space companies (or other government contracted companies due to the government having to pay more interest on future debt), and many more. These companies are not necessarily bad companies, I think Tesla is a great company and managed well by Elon Musk, but it is in a massive bubble and there’s no way investors are expecting meaningful returns from the business *at current stock prices*. As well as those companies, you should also look at any company overvalued based on a huge amount of debt where they are taking on more debt to grow (an interest increase causes debt to get much more expensive). I also suggest finding value investments as they thrive in a higher interest rate environment while growth stocks suffer, one of my favorites is DISCK which is merging with Warner Bros (A spin off of AT&amp;T), but I would wait until DISCK finds some solid support.

These are the companies I would investigate based on an increase in interest rate, and then you just need to identify the best choices for your risk tolerance and what best fits your investing personality. I don’t have DD for these suggestions which is why you should not invest without doing your own due diligence!!! Details were skipped here obviously but I am giving you the overall idea of why I have gone short on certain positions, and I am relying on you to dig deeper or find some DD as it would take me a long time to go into each individual stock (I would expect BurryEdge to produce more DD’s on different bubbles over the coming months).

**We have got to capitalize on Shortages**

Shortages are also a great place to find gains, although most ETF’s regarding commodities are already at extremely high levels. We should also look at companies that are still set to benefit, I really like SXC, OVV, and STNG. We have some great DD on those 3 stocks on the Burry Edge subreddit if anyone would like to look more into those stocks, as they are all undervalued stocks. OVV is a natural gas and oil company, meanwhile STNG is a petroleum transportation company. Both have great write ups and are companies I am personally invested in (I’ve made roughly 25% in just stocks from those 2 and I believe they have more upside). SXC is an investment in coke steel plants (a great way to take advantage of steel when scrap prices are high). Some of the ideas that has been discussed are ideas in the food industry as well (such as CORN). Another way to capitalize on this is in a retailer that has prepped for shortages and are in an advantageous position such as WMT, a stock I have written DD for as well, and you can read more information on why I believe they are specially built for a shortage’s environment in the coming months. Just be on the lookout for shortages and honestly following the shortages subreddit (I have no affiliation with this sub but they have great posts highlighting shortages) to follow future trends is probably not the worst idea. If you can get ahead of a shortages curve you can make a lot of money. Once again, I could have written much more but our community has other written pieces out there going in more detail, and I have given you the overall thesis for things to look into. If I were to jump into individual stocks I would take up way too much room. So, to summarize this paragraph; figure out where the shortages are going to be, actively pay attention to current shortages, find the undervalued companies in those sectors that are set to climb as prices increase.

Overall, in summary, inflation is here to stay, and we need to protect ourselves against it. I wish each of you good luck and I hope the information I have provided will help all of you achieve more financial freedom. I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, I hope it did not take away from the information given.

stocks,3150573,Roku: The Biggest Bubble in ARKK Investing?,qdnxv5,captnamurica2,1634929741,44,1," I am sure each of you know Roku. For those of you who don’t, Roku is a device that sells hardware products to help costumers stream to their favorite devices. They sell TVs, wireless speakers, and sticks/boxes. Roku currently has a massive share in the United States for streaming devices, taking up roughly 37% of the market. With that huge share of the market, Roku can now turn those devices into revenue machines with the use of advertising. Currently hardware accounts for 17% of Roku’s revenue while 83% comes from advertising/other platform profit. So of course, this is an amazing company that should be worth a lot of money for its strategic advantage. The thing is… It shouldn’t be worth $40 billion, or even near that amount.

**Roku is the dominant** ***US*** **player**

Roku is currently the leading CTV (Connected TV) company in the country, by taking a strong command on users switching to cord cutting methods. They use low margin devices to capture their audience then push them towards their high margin ad platform. Obviously, this was a great idea as they have been growing rapidly for years. But how much can this grow keep sustaining. From a device side, they are not growing well at all and are losing global market share, currently Amazon sells double the amount of devices worldwide (CTV devices) compared to Roku. In the United States they have been able to maintain their market share but not grow it as FireTV has rapidly snatched up market space, it will be interesting to see if users begin switching from Roku. This is unfortunate for them because the United States is not growing users like the rest of the world and Roku is struggling currently in building up its market share worldwide. Currently US viewing is only up 18% and I imagine that will shrink as we see Covid slowly go away. Based on their current market share trend they most likely will just increase their market share based on their growth with the US since market share hasn’t changed. Their current revenue growth looks extreme due to their transition to becoming an ad revenue-based company (which was a fantastic move) this will more than likely slow rapidly as they don’t pick up more viewers

**Globally, not so much**

Compared with the rest of the world South America had viewing grow by 240%, Africa grow by 149%, and Europe grow by 122%. Sadly, Roku has no more than an 8% share in those other markets.

This means that Roku is rapidly missing out on these fast-growing segments. Whereas Amazon and Samsung have taken over the market share in other areas. As these countries keep growing it will keep getting harder and harder for Roku to build up a considerable market share, to capture those viewers and their important ad revenue. These growth metrics aren’t by devices sold but by *viewing* hours on each device and outside of North America, Roku is struggling to keep up. Roku has lost total global market share with their total viewing time market dropping from 33% in Q1 of 2020 to Q2 of 2021. And remember as an advertising company that market share is crucial to maintain and 3% means a lot. Roku is attempting to gain ground as they just released in Brazil, Germany, and other places in the past few months.

**Google might be harder to get rid of than expected**

Roku’s current biggest partner for their Smart TV’s is the Chinese company, TCL. TCL has become a rapidly growing company in the United States and sells great devices. If you look up Roku TV’s, you’ll see an overwhelming amount of TCL’s. Well TCL, which since 2014 has exclusively sold to Roku, is now selling Android TV’s as of late last year. The partnership will most likely last a while as TCL is now producing android powered smart phones. This puts Roku in the crossfire of possibly losing market share in TCL TV’s hence reducing its total sales of TV’s. Especially because a large reason individuals buy TCL TVs has nothing to do with Roku but because of the quality of the TV. So, although google has fallen behind with Chromecast, the android TV could cause increased competition and a direct hit at Roku TV market share. Although losing TV doesn’t affect profit that much, it does lose costumers which can lead to future lost ad revenue.

**We are no longer in a pandemic**

The US is factually getting out of covid, and more people are getting out. Although this might be good for devices being bought (although with the chip shortage this could change) it is horrible for ad revenue especially with new users expected to slow so much in the US. 

Roku will most likely settle out as users lower their viewing habits, abet not as low as pre-pandemic levels but enough not to sustain the insane levels of growth priced into Roku stock. This won’t just affect Roku, but it will affect them more than other companies due to their lack of global market share. I would expect to see viewership growth to slow down over the coming years.

**Chip Shortages**

Chip shortages have decreased margins considerably on Roku devices as their CEO has committed to not raising prices, this makes sense because remember Roku needs to get individuals their devices to get ad revenue from them, so they are willing to take heavier losses on their players. I wouldn’t expect Roku devices to change considerably as input prices continue to increase. Gross margins turned negative for player items, and my assumption is that it has only gotten worse. Not to mention other input prices and shortages.

**Amazon is Closing in, in the United States**

Amazon this year has officially sold as many devices (CTV specific) as Roku and as far as number of users… Amazon will have caught Roku by 2023 and will have over 100 million users by the beginning of 2022, rapidly catching Roku. Roku in my opinion has zero moat. Their success has really been due to the success of TCL. I personally, and I have no data to back this up, don’t know anyone who goes out to specifically buy a Roku TV, most individuals want a smart TV and TCL provides a quality TV for a cheap price. Competitors such as Amazon and Google have a moat since users of other google or amazon devices benefit from using their “home” system whereas Roku is just used as a TV servicer. Amazon will most likely not lose customers because as people integrate amazon into their home, they are much more likely to keep their FireTV. Roku has no reason really for users to stick with their product if a better one becomes available. I believe this is why FireTV will actually start eating away at Roku’s market share especially as other bigger cable servicers start offering similar services such as Comcast (who just recently launched a plan to sell CTV devices giving away peacock on those devices to pull in customers). So, although Amazon is the only competition right now, I think it will get more competitive in the future and Roku does not have much to fight against that competition.

**Yeah, Roku is a bubble, a pretty big bubble.**

 Roku has blown up since the beginning of 2020, going up roughly 400% (1200% over the past 3 years) in their stock price which is intense. The reason is due to the huge gains in their high margin category of platform revenue. At current prices they would have to average 75%+ gains in net income and FCF to warrant a valuation of 40+ billion dollars. It just doesn’t make sense for them to continue to average gains like that when they just introduced their ad revenue (so obviously it would get a big initial boost), their user growth will most likely slow down, and interest rates along with tapering are set to rise. When the Fed shows any sign of pulling back M2 the market will pull back significantly because everything is in a bubble. A bubble acts as a Ponzi scheme, so right now at current valuations, investors are making money based on the fact that future individuals will keep buying, nothing to do with business fundamentals (this is pretty universal in any ARKK holding). So when the Ponzi scheme runs out of new money (M2 decreases, from tapering, or interest rates, etc.) then like most Ponzi schemes, everything immediately falls apart and it’s not pretty. Right now with a 40% increase in free cash flow over the next 10 years (which isn’t really reasonable when you account for the risk and lack of moat associated with Roku) then you get a share price of a whomping $62!!! The current share price as of this writing is $344. Of course, Roku has a nice to cash to debt ratio because it sold 4 million more share this year then it did the previous year (more than a 40% increase) since the stock price is insanely high. This was obviously a good move but it makes their balance sheet look a little less healthy. Overall I think something closer to an average of 25% in FCF increase is much more reasonable to Roku over the long run and that gives a share price of roughly $20. With shortages, competition, and Fed reduction money supply (or inflation just causing interest rates to increase) this will all cause devaluation of Roku over the next year or 2. There is also the new risk of what happened with Apple's privacy and advertisers, if this starts becoming more common place this could reduce the effectiveness of Rokus Ad Platform (we see what happened with $SNAP), although Apple has been historically protective of user privacy compared to other companies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qdnxv5/roku_the_biggest_bubble_in_arkk_investing/,1.0

stocks,2217763,Just a whole bunch of questions,lhqec8,twistedtoirtose,1613066343,3,1,"Hi, I've got quite a couple questions to ask, I'll try numbering them so it may be easier to answer if you just wanna answer one of them. Some of them might be stupid questions, or questions where the answer is just ""it's up to you, or it depends"", sorry I'm still pretty new. I'm thankful that there's a place here where newcomers like me can ask questions. 

1. I’ve recently been made aware of ARK and Cathie Wood. My question is do you guys recommend ARKK or ARKG? I do realize that they are focused on different things so “It depends” is most likely the answer I’ll get, but I thought it was still worth asking if there’s maybe one that you recommend more. 
2. Putting your money into an S&amp;P 500 ETF seems to be very popular (VOO, SPY, etc). The ARK ETFs (more specifically looking at ARKK and ARKG) seem to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. I assume the ARK ETFs are a bit more volatile and risky than just putting money into something like VOO, but this may be untrue. So, how much more risky is ARKK or ARKG and do you recommend putting the majority of the money you plan on investing into ETFs into VOO or should most of it be well invested in an ARK ETF?
3. When you are long on a stock and decide that you are content with your earnings and sell, do you reinvest the money you made somewhere else? Of course if you need the money then that’s that but if you don’t do you just put it in the next stock that you’re researched and think will give you a profit or do you maybe put it in a low risk ETF to sit for a while. I’m curious if people are constantly reinvesting their earnings (this question obviously highly depends on whatever YOU want to do with YOUR money so sorry if this is a bit of a stupid question, just wanna know what other people tend to do)
4. I understand exit strategy for individual stocks, take your profit when you have it, be happy, don’t get too greedy. My question once again relates to ETFs (you may be sensing a pattern). If you have an ETF with generally low risk (say an S&amp;P 500 ETF), do you ever think about closing your long position? Again assuming you don’t have a wedding coming up or something that you need the money for, do you just keep adding some money every month and hold until you’re 60? Do you periodically realize your gains or just let the wealth accrue until you decide to exit, and when do you decide to exit?

What my plan to do is take that money, put it into a Roth IRA split up evenly between a S&amp;P 500 index fund and several ETF’s including ARKK, ARKX (upon launch) and MSOS (as I believe this industry will boom in the coming 20-30 years just in time for me to want to retire as it levels out). My main question is this: Am I at least on the right path? I am currently unemployed but once I start working I plan on investing maybe $50-$100 per month into it (again split evenly among everything in it) and as I get better jobs I do plan eventually putting up to $500 into it. 

Any thoughts or tips? I know this isn’t the typical stock post but rather a long term true investment for my future. Thanks for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfth1l/just_turned_23_and_want_to_start_a_retirement_fund/,1.0

Port 1 - ROTH IRA:

Got about $30k split 67% VTSAX and 33% VFIAX. Nothing else. Contribute the yearly limit at beginning of the year, set, and forget.

Port 2 - Brokerage

Have about $102k split between the following:

AMD - ~1% @ $92/share

CRSR - ~1% @ $22/share

F - ~1% @ $11.2/share

ARKK - ~1.5% @ $144/share

SCHF - ~9.5% @ $37/share (shit doesn't fucking move)

SCHB - ~39% @ $95.2/share

SWPPX - ~39% @ $59.9/share

Cash - ~9.5%

I'm mostly looking for thoughts on the second portfolio. I'm 26 and willing to take on some risk before I get older. Thinking about getting out of SCHF and putting it into an ARK fund for now (ARKX I'm def gonna get in on when it's out). Just feel SCHF is a waste especially in my other retirement accounts I've had longer where international has been 1/6th or less the gains of US. Also unsure if I'm too ETF heavy and am open to any advice. I try to keep about 5% as BS money for swing-trading and gambles. The rest I want somewhat decent options for retirement.

\-20% AAPL: I've already made this investment, I think this is a no-brainer right now

\-20% DIS: Along with things like Disney+, DIS is bound to rebound as America opens up in the future. I'd like to go in on Disney for the long term but it's currently at ATH so I'm wary of buying in right now

\-20% BB: I already bought in at 14.40. I'm really upset I didn't wait just a few days when I could've bought in at \~12 but I'm confident in seeing them hit their ATH in the coming year or two

\-20% ARKK: I understand ARKK has already grown a ton in the past year, but I'm a believer in their innovation picks and I see a good amount of growth up ahead for the rest of the year

\-20% ARKG: I trust Cathie's investments in the genomic industry and I personally believe a genomic ""revolution"" lies ahead for us with the advances we're making in software

I know there are much safer picks out there and even some riskier ones, but in my eyes I think there is huge growth potential for this in the near future.

stocks,1011939,Major Option Purchases 12/23 - 12-31,kqh8kk,landstein,1609792363,1,1,"In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

# Call Flow

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Targeted Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kqh8kk/major_option_purchases_1223_1231/,1.0

stocks,1002397,Teladoc Health. Buy for 2021?,ko3pmx,redmitchM,1609469766,29,1,"Hi all, Happy New Years to you all! I hope we all have a better year in 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to post about Teladoc Health. Let me know if any of this information is incorrect, but I am just posting what I've found online. I think this is an extremely interesting and unique investment. They are the global leader in telemedicine, and I believe this is the way the future is moving. A study showed that 76% of consumers are interested in virtual care after COVID, as opposed to only 11% of people showing interest before COVID. I think COVID has made a permanent, ever lasting change in the way people view health and virtual appointments. 33% of people said they would leave their current physician to access virtual care as an alternative, and 66% of patients want their current physician to partner with a telehealth provider so that they can access care virtually. 

&amp;#x200B;

The generalized bull care for virtual health is; 1. Saves doctors and patients time travelling to and from the place of appointment, 2. Patients are more comfortable to do appointments from the comfort of their home, 3. Insurers will almost guaranteed charge less for virtual appointments. The generalized bear case would show that virtual care cannot provide sufficient details as a physical appointment would, and you cannot check normal vitals such as blood pressure, etc. Most of the time the doctor will send you for bloodwork anyways, so accessing that prescription online is completely fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basing most of these financials off of their latest release (3Q2020). YoY Q3 revenues increased 109% to 289M. Total visits increased 206% to 2.8 million for the quarter. For the first 3 quarters, their revenue grew 79% to 711M and total visits increased 163% to 7.6 million. For the FULL fiscal year 2020, their **revenue is expected to grow 96% to 1.09B**. Assuming the 4th quarter visits are the same, they should have around **10 million visits for the full year**, which would be **\~140% visitation growth YoY** (in financial statements they actually say around 10.5 million visits is expected, so a little more than 140%). It is clear visits are skyrocketing and revenues are growing very quick as well. Net loss per share in 2019 was 1.38, as opposed to the expected net loss per share in 2020 to be 1.28, just a 7% increase. This would put Teladoc at a 27 P/S ratio, pretty high; and earnings are still heavily negative. They are going to burn over 100M in losses this year, and with only 1.19B in cash and 1B in debt; the fundamentals don't look all that fantastic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward, the EPS for 2021 are expected to be a loss of 54 (per share), a 58% increase YoY, up from the expected 7% for 2020. Revenues are expected to climb aggressively again to 1.95B, an 80% increase YoY. According to 22 analysts Teladoc's first profitable year will be 2023, where they will make 163M. So based off 2 more years of  losses, this means if they continue business as is they will burn less than 200M of their 1B cash, and perhaps can use that remaining cash to worry about short term debt (which they have a lot). I could also see them doing another offering of shares to raise capital one last time for continued aggressive expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

Teladoc has had a 67% CAGR in revenue from 2015-2020, so this basically demolishes the idea that it is a ""COVID stock"" or ""stay-at-home stock"". It has had consistent growth since 2015, but this isn't to say that COVID hasn't helped them. COVID has forced/gave people the choice to move their healthcare virtually, and Teladoc claims they have a 90% client retention rate. Meaning most people who try Teladoc once, continue to use it, a great sign. Just looking back into 2018 until now, they have provided free telehealth visits for those affected by Hurricane Florence, Lane, Laura and Sally - as well as California/Western Wildfires. With a 90% retention rate a lot of the individuals who take advantage of these visits probably stay on as permanent Teladoc patients; a fantastic business move while giving positive press regarding the company. In 2019 Teladoc also partnered with Johnston Group - in which 30,000 small to medium sized businesses with the Chambers of Commerce Group Insurance Plan would be able to use their platform.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intel** recently donated to the **World Telehealth Initiative (WTI)**, a non-profit organization who will leverage Teladoc's telemedicine platform to expand access to care in less developed countries. Teladoc Health has received an endorsement from the **National Labor Alliance of Health Care Coalitions (NLA)** \[the largest alliance of labor unions and labor management coalitions\] and 2 accreditations though **ClearHealth Quality Institute Telemedicine Accreditation Program (TAP)**. Nationally recognized agencies are giving Teladoc public compliments. Just added publicity is good. 

&amp;#x200B;

They have expanded to give access to virtual healthcare, nutrition services with access to actual nutritionists, mental health care services with access to psychiatrists/psychologists. Teladoc has presence in **175+ countries**, and 60 of the top 100 hospitals use Teladoc and Livongo solutions to run their operations. With the acquisition of Livongo, Teladoc has added another exceptional dimension to its business. Livongo provides managed care for chronic illness patients; it collects data and leans on artificial intelligence to come up with solutions and tips those patients to live healthier lives. On their own, Livongo are a positive earning company and have only captured 1% of their addressable market in the U.S. Primarily they deal with diabetic patients and have near-doubled their diabetic patient count in each of the last 4 years. Paired with Teladoc, Livongo believes they can offer its services to over 50,000 members with diabetes; and their solutions can be applied to many more chronic illnesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Teladoc also acquired **MedecinDirect** \- the market leading telemedicine provider in France. In September 2018 they announced Teladoc Global Care Services - 24/7 worldwide service. Looking at the global growth we can see from 2017 to 2019; revenue from outside-of-the-U.S sources was 19M, 75M, 108M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Just for reference; revenue from inside-the-U.S sources was 215M, 343M, and 445M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. We can see that the proportion of revenue from outside of the U.S is growing on a % basis - a very good sign for Teladoc; meaning their goal of diversifying and expanding their network is working. In 2020 over 20% of their revenue will come from outside the U.S. 

&amp;#x200B;

The average rating from 27 analysts is $242.78, a 20% upside from current price, with a high of $305, over 50% upside from current price. Yahoo rates Teladoc a 2.1 between a Hold (3) and a Buy (2) - closer to a Buy. On SeekingAlpha it is rated at just above a 4, which implies Bullish. Walletinvestor expects a 1-Year Forecast of $340 (71% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $873 (335% upside). Govcapital gives a 1-Year Forecast of $345 (73% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $1335 (565% upside). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these values are slightly rounded, taken as of December 31, 2020. **ARKK**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 4.31% (3,882,585 shares at a value of $790,377,828). **ARKW**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 3.53% (933,334 shares at a value of $189,998,802). **ARKG**'s 3rd largest holding is TDOC at 5.75% (2,249,762 shares at a value of $457,984,050). **ARKF**'s 36th largest holding is TDOC at 1.05% (103,554 shares at a value of $21,080,488). Together this means that 4 of the 5 ARK funds hold this company. The 4 funds that do have Teladoc shares have **7,169,235 shares** at a value of **$1,459,441,168**, or an average share price of **$203.57/share** (a 1.8% downside off of December 31, 2020 closing price). In the past few weeks/months ARK funds have been buying into this company heavily. Do we really think they would invest 1.5 billion USD into it if they didn't believe it would be a good company, with good growth, near and long term? 

&amp;#x200B;

In total there is 61% institutional holding. There is also 6% insider holding, meaning they have a lot of money in the company. In the past 12 months insiders have sold 822,242 shares and bought 104,618 shares. That means a net of 717, 624 share sold, which makes sense because it had a huge growth year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Teladoc has a very high volatility it seems, with over 10% of shares shorted as of December 15, 2020. This is down from November in which 15% of shares were shorted. So if you are currently, or looking to invest into the Teladoc Health company, expect a high level of volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** I do **NOT** hold a position in Teladoc but am heavily eyeing it. I think it shows great signs of a growth company. Another really large benefit is they are a medical stock; they do nothing but good for the people. They provide healthcare virtually in regions where doctors give insufficient care or where there is no care at all. Who doesn't want to invest in something that helps people while also getting good returns? I personally think that it seems like a sound company for a small position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any discussion would be awesome! As always, **do your own due diligence**, I highly encourage it. Into the New Year I wish everyone well wishes, and good luck!

Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to China corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. 

Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will become in default on September 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood. 

Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and ""head for the exit in a crowded theater.""

IMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.

DNA aka Ginkgo Bioworks  is building the leading horizontal platform for cell programming across all industries similar to AWS. Its mission is to ""make biology easier to engineer"". Wtf does this even mean? Programming biology is to the physical world what programming computers is to the information economy. To learn more about Ginko you can follow this \[[thread](https://twitter.com/alexroznowski/status/1392509680883228677?s=20)\]. Biology is clearly not my area lol. 

Anyway, since $DNA was recently attacked by two disreputable short sellers it shot on my radar. Scorpion Capital and Citron Research both released short attacks within 5min of each other, this tanked the stock. SpacMan found this coordination odd \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1445752444613369858?s=20)\] and it raised my suspicion as well. Since then, ARK (one of the pipe investors) issued statements saying they would issue a “very thorough rebuttal” soon \[[link](https://discord.com/channels/@me/892777899277574215#:~:text=https%3A//twitter.com/bursatilbiotech/status/1446114812228894726%3Fs%3D21)\], and backed up this statement by buying more shares \[[link](https://www.businessinsider.com/cathie-wood-ark-invest-ginkgo-bioworks-spac-soaring-eagle-arkk-2021-8?amp)\] -- loading over 100m after the short attack.  The PIPE for this stock is solid with an estimated 82% held by long funds \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1438679140782182404?s=20)\]. The PIPE includes ARK,Cascade (Bill Gate’s investment fund),  Morgan Stanley Inv Mgmt among others.  It’s hard for me to believe the claims from the short firms when Shyam COO of PLTR is on the board, and analysts are giving outperform targets \[[William Blair OutPerform 10/12](https://investorplace.com/2021/10/dna-stock-the-bull-call-that-has-ginkgo-bioworks-bouncing-back-after-last-weeks-scam-accusation/)\] *even* *after* the publication of the short report.  So, either William Blair Investments is stupid, or the shorts are missing something, or the pipe investors are in cahoots with anaysts to give bullish ratings, which I dont dismiss either. But it’s basically MIT+ARK+Bill Gates vs Scorpion Capital, and the last company Scorpion attacked and called a scam $BLI, just said that they expect to meet their revenue forecasts, so credibility is an issue. At the end of the week ARK is expected to send a rebuttal \[[link](https://twitter.com/sbarnettark/status/1447579548137185285?s=21)\], I am unsure if this will add anything given the bullish rating from analysts.

# Scorpions Short Report

So here is the dreaded report: [https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/DNA1.pdf](https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/DNA1.pdf).

Most of the claims from this report are fully disclosed. We can debate the fundamentals of the company all we want but it’s just too hard to “value” rn. The downstream potential is massive even if only a handful of the programs play out as they say it will. And the fact that they’re 100% focused on top of funnel just increases their chances of success. As long as they’re able to continue getting free VC money to fund their spin offs and using that to fund their foundry, the show goes on. Even if the downstream royalties never materialize as stated, they’ll always have something else in the pipeline to keep investors hooked. Anyway, it’s to my understanding that most longs in DNA are fully aware they’re overpaying for the company fundamentals as it is today. They’re betting on future downstream royalties and the potential of syn bio to change the world, as in they want the multi-bagger moonshot.The CEOs constant pandering to retail seems to have built quite a loyal base reminiscent of TSLA. He’s a good shill which is a positive. 

# Squeeze Metrics

Just looking at the short metrics it looks like shorts are a bit extended. On IBKR shares available to borrow ran out completely with the last known fee at 124.7%  \[according to iborrowdesk and fintel\]  which is pretty high. However if you login to IBRK TradingView you will see that the last known fee is over to 200% and the borrow rate is the classical moon pattern. 

*Processing img gxjenwqrh3t71...*

The fee is skyrocketing with no shares available, which is eye raising. I had a python script hitting the IBKR API all day watching to see if shares became available.  On Ortex for the last 2-days the borrow rate has been at 300%+ as well. 

Below are ORTEX screenshots from today:

Need to find lock-up agreement for this, so I checked the \[[424B3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521246097/d177007d424b3.htm)\]. *Typically, I check the S-4, S-4/A and 424B3 or PREM14A, PRER14A and DEFM-14A + do a simple search for ""lock-up"".* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cijmjso2i3t71...*

From this excerpt we can say that the 1b+ Ginkgo shares are locked up for a year. 

## PIPE

Got lucky, someone already estimated that 82% of PIPE held by long term investors \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1438679140782182404?s=20)\]. I find this calculation to be reasonable, so I’ll use it. We know PIPE is 76,000,000 shares, so 18% of this number is 13,680,000. So of the 76m pipe shares an estimated 13.680m shares are in the float. 

## SPONSOR

We are going to refer to the screenshot above from the \[[424B3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521246097/d177007d424b3.htm)\] again. The closing of the business combination happened on September 16, 2021, and 180days from that day is March 17, 2022. So, the sponsor's 14,852,765 shares are lockup until then. 

## SRNG Share Holders

So this is typically what the public can buy so going to look at institutional holds. Let’s take care of ARK which has been loading the boat.

*Processing img rclvc426i3t71...*

&amp;#x200B;

From the table above we know that 1.5m is part of the PIPE,

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img o7ifdg67i3t71...*

Additionally, from the screenshot above we know ARK total holdings is 35.726m shares. So to avoid double counting the PIPE calculations subtract 1.5m ARK pipe shares from  35.726m of total ARK shares to get to 34.226m shares. If we subtract these 34.226m shares from 85,774,688 (the SRNG shares) we are left with 51,548,688 shares. 

So, the estimate of float is 51,548,688 + 14,852,765 = 66,401,453.

DNA is too new of a stock to figure out what other ETF’s have it in their holdings, and 13d/f filings are at the end of the quarter so I can’t figure out if any funds added to their position. However, the sky high borrow rate and lack of availability of shares to borrow makes me believe that the float is lower \[retail + other institutions buying\]. Anyway, using the number’s we just calculated and the estimated SI on Ortex of 16.75m, it follows that estimated SI/Float is 25%, which makes the SI pretty significant. S3 estimates SI to be 12.66m, so estimate SI/Float from S3 is 19% if we use the float calculations which is still pretty significant.

In addition to lockup mentioned above, there also lockup associated with share performance for the “earnout shares”:

*Processing img 2r52s4ebi3t71...*

&amp;#x200B;

Not really worried about these shares since it only triggers if $DNA is significantly above its current price, however it does introduce incentives for longs to hodl.

# Conclusion

My position is 6quadrillion options. Clearly I’m betting betting that the longs hodl rather than scalp short term gains, and some sort of intense price action occurring pretty soon. I have to assume that Scorpion has already covered. The shorts that piled on after have not however.

wallstreetbets,10882203,Disruptive Innovation: Tips For Making Money Like Cathie,pxsbnq,OogdayAyday,1632910302,3,1,"I am a disciple of Cathie Wood. Although we have not interacted directly, she taught me all about investing from virtual podcasts, YouTube, and Twitter, and I have shadowed her trading methodologies for around 1 year. I may be as young as her analysts, but I sure as hell know more about the markets than so-called ""market professionals""! So in this post, I would like to teach you what I learned from Cathie, so that you may send thy portfolio aboard an Ark that bounds towards the heavens.

**1. Buy TSLA**

Tesla is an autonomous robo-taxi company that will rise to $3,000 per share by 2025 for numerous reasons.

**2. Understand “disruptive innovation”**

The best way to make money is to comprehend disruptive innovation. Disruptive innovation is the convergence of multitudinous factors including creative destruction, S curves, Moore’s Law, Wright’s Law, and exponential growth trajectories. Furthermore, the synthesis of technologically enabled disruptive innovation and creative destruction represent collective deflationary phenomena that should enable high-growth strategies to prevail ([proof here](https://twitter.com/CathieDWood/status/1427593342939025412)). Importantly, these variables will naturally amalgamate to produce roughly 15% annual returns over a 5-year time horizon.

**3. Invest in the right side of change**

Now that you are an expert on disruptive innovation, you must buy companies that embody disruptive innovation, because they are on the right side of change. Here is a checklist to identify whether you should buy the company:

* **Industry Analysis:** The company must operate in a high-tech industry. The less people understand the industry, the better.
* **Buzzword Analysis:** The company must revolve around captivating keywords including genomic sequencing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain innovation, cloud computing, and energy storage. If it doesn’t mention any of these, it’s almost certainly a value trap.
* **Profitability Analysis:** The company must have a consistent history of net losses. Profitable companies are not investing in growth and nobody wants that.
* **Multiples Analysis:** The company must trade at a minimum of 5 times EV/sales. The higher the multiple, the better.

**4. Buy at the right price**

The right price is defined as the current market price of the stock, whatever it may be.

**5. Buy at the right time**

The right time is defined as either 1) IPO or 2) when the stock is at all time high

**6. Learn to love the set-up**

It is occasionally possible that disruptive companies see their stock sell off in a big way. In such scenarios, you must reassure yourself that 1) the bull market is broadening, 2) the rotation is good news, and 3) you love this set-up.

Strategies to use when your portfolio is down 50% include: 1) cutting losses at all time lows, 2) selling your blue chips to backstop your small caps, and/or 3) swing trading Chinese stocks.

**7. Publish your research and positions for all to see**

Retail investors are invaluable market participants who deserve informational democratization. Thus, always attempt to disseminate free due diligence on online channels including Reddit forums.

If an idiot opens puts on your portfolio, respond on Twitter with the following template:

&gt;To **\[his/her\]** credit, **\[insert idiot's name here\]** made a great call based on fundamentals and recognized **\[insert said idiot's overrated achievement\]**. I do not believe that **\[he/she\]** understands the fundamentals that are creating explosive growth and investment opportunities in the innovation space.

If you have an audience, also disclose your positions on a daily basis. Mine are below:

* **Disclosure:** I developed a sophisticated portfolio using disruptive innovation strategies
* **Portfolio Position:** 100% concentration in ARKK and down 10% YTD. I love this set up though",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pxsbnq/disruptive_innovation_tips_for_making_money_like/,1.0

# **Stocks face another turbulent week as the third quarter winds down - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/stocks-face-another-turbulent-week-as-the-third-quarter-winds-down.html)**
*****
&gt; After recent turbulence, markets are likely to close out the final week of the third quarter with another bout of volatility.
*****
&gt; Stocks posted big moves in the past week. First, fears of financial contagion coming from Chinese developer Evergrande sent stocks skidding Monday. Those losses were reversed by Thursday, when the market ripped higher. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were positive for the week, while the Nasdaq was flat.
*****
&gt; “I think this market turmoil has yet to conclude,” CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said. “Certainly September is doing what it normally does. It frustrates investors.”
*****
&gt; The three major stock indexes are also higher for the third quarter.
*****
&gt; Strategists say how the market trades in the coming week may be the most important development, after the wild swings in stocks and also the rapid rise in Treasury yields late in the week. The 10-year rate had shot up to 1.46% by Friday after trading at about 1.31% on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/cw3qZgY.png
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for September.
*****
&gt; “We are getting long in the tooth. The technical indicators are pointing to distribution. We’re seeing prices roll over, breadth roll over. You’re seeing sentiment roll over,” Stovall said, noting the market’s breadth needs to improve, and many stocks are trading below their 200-day moving average.
*****
&gt; # October is a ‘seismic’ month
“I think October will be true to itself, which is a very volatile month. October’s volatility is 36% higher than the average of the other 11 months of the year,” Stovall added. “Volatility is higher and you have a greater number of pullbacks, corrections and bear markets that either start or end in the month. It is a seismic month.”
*****
&gt; Wealth management firm Wellington Shields warns that the fact many stocks have fallen below their 200-day moving average is a negative for the market. Just 59% of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange remain above it, or in an uptrend, according to the firm. The 200-day moving average is the average of the last 200 closing prices of a stock or index, and it’s viewed as a momentum indicator.
*****
&gt; “The rule is that when this 200-day number drops from above 80% to below 60%, it usually goes below 30%. Forgetting that, the real point is that while most stocks may be advancing, barely more than half are advancing enough to be in uptrends. With the market just a few percent below its highs, this is a concern,” Wellington said in a note.
*****
&gt; # What to watch
In the coming week, there are a few key economic reports including including durable goods Monday and ISM manufacturing Friday. There is also personal consumption expenditure data Friday, which the Federal Reserve monitors for its inflation index.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will remain a big focus in the week ahead. There will be a host of Fed speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who testifies twice before Congress on the pandemic and the policy response to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will join him for the hearings Tuesday and Thursday. Powell also appears on a European Central Bank panel with other central bank leaders Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching Congress in the week ahead, as lawmakers attempts to pass a funding plan in time to avert a government shutdown Oct. 1. The debt ceiling is expected to be part of that debate, but strategists do not expect it to be resolved at the same time. They say this could hang over the markets for several weeks before Congress raises the debt ceiling.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers are not expected to provide any new information, but they could fine tune their message after the central bank signaled this past Wednesday that it expects to begin paring down its $120 billion in in monthly bond purchases soon. The Fed also released a new forecast for interest rates, which revealed that half of the 18 Fed officials expect to raise interest rates next year.
*****
&gt; “I think what the Fed’s achieved so far is a taper without a tantrum,” Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist Marc Chandler said.
*****
&gt; “I think a lot of people who invest in the market have a sense they are skating on thin ice, and any crack could be a big one. ... People are highly sensitive and nervous because they know valuations are stretched,” he said. “That means we should expect these episodic jumps in volatility.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said the market will need to digest the recent moves, particularly the move higher in Treasury yields.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/04o6okR.png
*****
&gt; “What we’ve got to wait for now is finding this new equilibrium. What kind of market should we expect? Trending? Or do we try to find a range?” he said. “I think we find a range. We need some hurdles to pass.” Chandler added that one hurdle is the September jobs report on Oct. 8.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to taper its $120 billion monthly bond purchases unless there is shockingly weak employment data. “That is the only thing that stands in the way of Fed tapering,” Chandler said.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said the quarter end could be quiet in terms of big funds rebalancing. “The equity market bounced around. It’s up on the quarter. That wasn’t much when you compare it to the bond performance,” he said.
*****
&gt; The 10-year yield made an unusually volatile round trip move in the third quarter. It was 1.47% on June 30, and it was as high as 1.46% on Friday. In between, it dipped to 1.12% in early August. Schumacher said the bond market could be quieter ahead of the quarter end, and the 10-year yield could then resume its move higher.
*****
&gt; Some strategists watch the 10-year Treasury yield as a leading indicator for stocks. It is also linked to moves in technology and other high-growth stocks.
*****
&gt;  # What’s next
Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton said high growth and tech are susceptible now to moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. She said the technology sector is the most overbought in relative terms, when comparing the sector to the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P 500 tech sector was up nearly 1% for the week, and it was up nearly 6% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; ""We would consider reducing exposure to growthy ETFs like ARKK and would be respectful of any breakdowns,” Stockton said.
*****
&gt; Investors have been fixated on the S&amp;P 500′s 50-day moving average, which sat at 4,439 on Friday. For the first time this year, the index broke below and closed under the average for multiple sessions this past week. By Thursday, it regained the 50-day and finished above it. The broad-market index closed above the 50-day moving average on Friday, at 4,455.
*****
&gt; The 50-day is literally the average of the last 50 closing prices, and it is viewed as an important momentum indicator, just as the 200-day moving average is. A break above could signal a positive move, and a break below it could mean more downside.
*****
&gt; Stockton said the relief rally in the S&amp;P 500 could resume in the coming week. “But we think it will fade by the end of the week given the downturns in our intermediate-term indicators. We expect the SPX to make a lower high,” she wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; She expects the 10-year Treasury yield could continue higher. “Momentum appears to be shifting to the upside and next resistance is near 1.53%. The breakout should benefit the financial sector, which saw significant outperformance [Thursday],” Stockton noted.

&gt; # September Seasonality Update

&gt; Well. Seasonality is back. Everyone in the financial media has been talking about September seasonal weakness lately. And here we are in September and the market has sold off the 5% or so we projected last month. And it did so in the notoriously treacherous week after September quarterly options and futures expiration.

&gt; Then as expected traders and fund managers bought the 5% dip as they have throughout this bull market rally with the blessing of the Federal Reserve’s continuing dovish tone and accommodative policy that they reinforced at the conclusion of yesterday’s FOMC meeting.

&gt; We do not expect stocks to succumb to the October curse this year. That doesn’t rule out some downside disturbance, but we do not foresee an impending crash, massacre or big selloff of the sort that have given October it’s dubious reputation as the jinx month.

&gt; Many of the same geopolitical, political, fundamental and technical headwinds we highlighted last month remain, as well as some others, so another 5% or so pullback is quite likely as Wall Street still may suffer from chronic “Octoberphobia.”

&gt; We’ve been doing this for decades and this pullback was prototypical end of Q3 window dressing and institutional selling. Several factors weighed on the markets, but most had been there all year. So why did the market selling off this month? Seasonality.

&gt; # Individual Investor Sentiment Bounces Back

&gt; Last week saw a massive decline in optimism according to the AAII's weekly investor sentiment survey. In fact, bullish sentiment saw its largest one-week decline in over two years. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has technically declined more in the week leading up to this week's survey than last week's, sentiment actually improved with the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish rising from 22.4% to 29.9%. That was the biggest one-week increase since the first week of July, but the percentage of bullish respondents is still well below the past year's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Even though there was a big pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment was only little changed. This reading only fell 0.1 percentage points to 39.3%. That remains at a level above anything observed since last fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That means that mostly all of the gains to bullish sentiment this week borrowed heavily from the neutral camp. Neutral sentiment fell sharply this week shedding 7.4 percentage points. That was the biggest one-week decline since a 7.5 percentage point drop in the first week of August.

&gt; We'd also note that while last week saw a big shift in sentiment among individual investors, this week, newsletter writers followed suit as bullish sentiment among that group fell below 50% to 47.1% for the lowest reading since May. Bearish sentiment meanwhile rose to 22.3% which is the highest reading since October 7th of last year.

ARKK: long 115 shares 81.38 cost basis, up 32%, around 12.4K current value 

The fintech one: long 100 shares 44.1 cost basis, up 60.96%, around 4.8k current value

ARKW: long 100 shares 92.87 cost basis, up 54% around 14.2k current value.

Occasionally, on high days I will sell off five or 10 shares but I have remained 100 shares so I can sell options.

I don’t know whether to sell or to hold onto these for the long term. They are basically all long term capital gains.

I am in my twenties and am looking for aggressive growth. 

Do you guys believe these ARK funds will rally back??? 

I sell covered calls to collect premiums but it’s penny’s compared to what I could be making in unrealized gains in Individual stocks.

I feel some comfort in knowing Kathy is managing my finances and part of the reason I haven’t sold yet is because I don’t even know where I would put around $50,000.

wallstreetbets,11191440,ARK seems to be a broken clock,qxa77u,tyrsdisciple,1637303570,1,1,"... they are right about twice a day.  

I saw the headlines that Cathie Wood was dumping on Ford and GM for not having EVs already (more or less) and they don't have the ""DNA"".  I got curious and looked up some of their funds to see where they put their money.

I found ARKF, their FinTech fund and it's a whose who of FinTech losers this quarter.  Their largest holdings are SQ, COIN, Z, SHOP, TDOC, OPEN, ADYEN.  That's some seriously high potential bag holding there.  I don't know all these companies but I know that at least 5 of those aren't what I call great.  In fact, I have puts on some of them (tiny ones, just starting out).  It doesn't get much better with ARKK, ARKQ, ARKW.

Near as I can tell almost all of their funds rely on TSLA to do all the heavy lifting in the ETF.  If that's the case, who exactly does Cathie think is going to beat GM and Ford aside from TSLA when it comes to electric?  I can't find a meaningful position on any of their ETFs for any other companies in this sector.  In fact, if I had a bit more money and TSLA downtrends for any length of time, their ETFs would make great targets for puts.

Kinda want to see if Cathie puts her money where her mouth is and says who her company will be trying to prop up since she has such strong opinions on the matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxa77u/ark_seems_to_be_a_broken_clock/,1.0

This is lining up to be a perfect technical, fundamental and crazy Elon tweet storm of bearishness for $ARKK.

Looking at the chart $ARKK has not joined in the most recent 'everything rally'. It's not near new highs and is at some technical resistance.

It's largest holding is $TSLA which has been on a screamer and to me looks blow off toppy. It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.

I think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.

The question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?

I am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:

**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**

I believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable.

CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

 It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

 Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

 

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

April 1,2021 : If Your Mutual Fund Becomes an ETF, Here’s Why : Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood brought attention to the category with her slate of actively managed funds that were among the best performing U.S. ETFs in 2020.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html)

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Cathie Wood : Worth $250 million as of October 13,2020 : Truly self-made and EXTREMELY successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathie Wood certainly is a disruptor. Lots of gutsy and extremely unusual stock market moves . An early investor of Twilio Inc, Square Inc., Spotify Technology S.A. stock and Shopify Inc.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's leave with the immortal words of John Templeton :

“It is impossible to produce SUPERIOR performance unless you do SOMETHING DIFFERENT from the majority.”

Sir John Templeton : In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years.

**April 17,2021 : Summary :**

**a) CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”**

**b) Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.**

**c) It’s also somewhat unusual for being ""an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs"".**

&amp;#x200B;

**So how do the charts look like over the long-term for this extraordinary ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) or ARK Innovation ETF  ? Pretty amazing.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present !**

**Note :  I only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date !**

&amp;#x200B;

**Hard to believe but the results AND charts/prices/numbers speak for themselves !** 

""**Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices"" and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive !**

&amp;#x200B;

**High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then THAT is ""WORLD CLASS"" stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT !**

**Cathie Wood is a genuinely EXTRAORDINARY and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that ! Her FAR ABOVE AVERAGE results speak volumes about her skills and abilities !** 

**Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY (not monthly/weekly) basis !** 

**LOVE the transparency !!! Very, very, VERY unusual.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's look at her track record  : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret !**

Probably poorly I suspect even if you diversified into commodities, metals and financials, and hell even if you were smart enough to pick up some utilities and pure defensives.

How do I know? Well, I'm a sentiment and technical autist sorta, I have 65 active positions all based on DD here, and I go long (or short) on A LOT of the DD""s posted on here and have been doing so for the last four years, IF I like them and the chart doesn't look like an erect penis and the options are liquid enough, I usually take 2-4 calls/puts atm 2-6 months out. 

If you guys remember in Dec, Jan, Feb virtually every solid DD post produced gains! Now what?! Oh, we have a ""healthy"" sector rotation, that's why the SPY is at $400 and most of our DD's are losing to theta or producing whimsical gains despite the fact we now have near 10 million degenerates and have tripled our numbers in 2 months.

If you're a prick from a sketchy ass organization with 2/3rds of its $300 Billion in offshore accounts and you're getting beaten by retail traders but also have the ability to repo billions of short terms loans at .01% interest from the fed what would you do? https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/

https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

I would probably borrow more money and short the hell out of every name on here and Citadel is not the only player doing this. If non-hedge funds like Kathy Wood's succeeds, hedge funds who keep 50% of their clients funds stand to lose (well...potentially everything including their jobs). Need some proof: take a look at the market currently vs $ARKK and $ARKQ . Kathy will succeed long term for sure, actively managed non hedge funds like hers that only charge a fraction of what hedgies charge will be the future, unless hedge funds can change that viewpoint. 

Need more Proof: How is $UWMC, $NOK, $BB $SENS doing for you guys (undervalued stocks, with strong fundamentals, in a strong sector with the $SPY breaking new all time highs regualrly) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5yvwc/uwmc_key_points_to_the_company/

More proof: Prior to the $GME sage, virtually every single ticker in which the author took the time to write out some solid DD and which received more than just 50 upvotes within a few hours, would generally just gap up within the next day or two. Now a ticker might receive a few hundred upvotes in that time span, the market continues up, the sector is currently one of the hot ones and yet the stock goes down. 

TLDR; if and/or when the repo market eventually blows up and interest rates go from .01% to 1% overnight and firms over levered to the tits go belly up like these last 3, you guys better still be holding your $GME shares bc at least we can fuck them on $GME.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mith20/how_wall_street_citadel_is_fucking_us/,1.0

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\_has\_no\_clothes/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

 I would probably borrow more money and short the hell out of every name on here and Citadel is **not the only player doing this.**  If non-hedge funds like Kathy Wood's succeeds, **hedge funds who keep 50% of their clients funds stand to lose (well...potentially everything including their jobs).**  Need some proof:  take a look at the market currently vs $ARKK and $ARKQ **.**  Kathy will succeed long term for sure, actively managed non hedge funds like hers that only charge a fraction of what hedgies charge will be the future, **unless hedge funds can change that viewpoint**.  

**Need more Proof**: How is $UWMC, $NOK, $BB $SENS doing for you guys (undervalued stocks, with strong fundamentals, in a strong sector with the $SPY breaking new all time highs regualrly) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5yvwc/uwmc\_key\_points\_to\_the\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5yvwc/uwmc_key_points_to_the_company/)

 **More proof:** Prior to the $GME sage, virtually every single ticker in which the author took the time to write out some solid DD and which received more than just 50 upvotes within a few hours, would generally just gap up within the next day or two.   Now a ticker might receive a few hundred upvotes in that time span, the market continues up, the sector is currently one of the hot ones and yet the stock goes down.  

**TLDR;** if and/or when the repo market eventually blows up and interest rates go from .01% to 1% overnight and firms over levered to the tits go belly up like these last 3, you guys better still be holding your $GME shares bc at least we can fuck them on $GME.

**Final question for you:** How do you beat a firm that can borrow billions at .01% interest and continuously short the shit out of you?  I am in favor of a more collective approach towards having 1  top DD of the week for a particular ticker with the mods create a separate filter to see this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi1pjs/how_wall_street_and_citadel_are_fucking_us_why/,1.0
wallstreetbets,9686746,Palantirians loss farming for tax,mftj1t,hgr808,1617035799,9,1,"To my fellow Palantirians let me know what you think about farming losses. 

First and foremost, covered calls seem like a garbage premium for a stock you know can bounce and you’ll basically have a ticket for takeoff but you presold it for a few percentages. Not worth it honestly. We all wish we were DFV and bought the bottom but you didn’t have to buy the bottom to make millions. Even he stomached losses for over a year. I love that man. Anyways... 

Some of us have some serious short term capital gains tax to pay next year. If you are classified as a trader (easily obtained if you simply set aside a few thousand and have fun day trading, you might make some, lose some but you will fall into a classification that will save you loads on taxes) you can write off all your losses. So what can we do? Well I’m holding PLTR and started buying at $34 (average cost is now $27.70) so what I want to run by y’all is the idea of using leverage and the wash rule. Because i believe in this stock i don’t want to get off. However, one thing i can do to lower my cost as well as offset my short term profits is to buy a ton of shares on margin and then wait 30 days and sell that same amount. Because of First in First out rule you can choose to realize a loss on the shares I bought at $34 but i never got off the rocket in the meantime. Since I’m in the highest tax bracket this year I’m having to pay near 40% tax so if i can use a dip to realize losses i will be saving $0.40 for every $1 profit i offset and then later get charged only a 20% tax when i sell at long term capital gains rates so i will truly be saving $0.20 on every dollar i write off as a loss. So now my Palantir dip can save me loads of money. If the stock tanks in the 30 day period for the wash rule, that margin could hurt me and I would need to make sure I’m clear of a margin call possibly by selling some early and if the Stock pops in that 30 day period, i make more money. I think the potential savings on my taxes will be very beneficial. What are y’all’s thoughts? I wouldn’t want to sell and wait 30 days to repurchase that’s why i want to buy on margin wait 30 days and then sell my original shares i got at a higher price. 

I believe in PLTR long Term and i really would rather stomach losses than get off. This is a long term hood so the end goal would be to offset my short term capital gains but then hold the Palantir shares for well over a year which will then put me in the long term capital gains category. 

On a side note, i just joined Pappa Musk and will sell at a loss if it drops but then buy ARKK because they practically match TSLA charts so i can realize a loss but still enjoy the rebound.

wallstreetbets,9579681,"Teradyne Inc DD, a stock with increasing online chatter",m709l5,akokaz1,1615987299,0,1,"Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

### Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

### Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

&amp;#x200B;

[5 Year Net Income for Teradyne, rising from -$43m in 2016 to $784m in 2020. Return on Equity was 42.49&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/h23vdc1aaln61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be5437b649cbc2b03a13cadadd0ca0eee90ef6b)

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

### Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

### Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

[Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/e5rxrx48aln61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d012a19c15c1664614c9c953adcee881b4020f)

### Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m709l5/teradyne_inc_dd_a_stock_with_increasing_online/,1.0

**Maxar Technologies DD**

Background  
 It's space stock trading at a market cap \~$3B with &gt;$1.7B in yearly revenue and $0.3B net profit ,2020 got hit really hard after a series of bad situations which was pretty much the perfect storm: downturn in large satellite contracts, short sell attack, high debt, potential dividend elimination, satellite failure, trouble in liquidating part of business (GEO), transition from Canadian to US based forcing big Canadian holders to sell.

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $45 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors. 

The Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.

Read here an interview with the CEO Dan Jablonsky about Worldview-Legion, which will be their new constellation of imagery satellites scheduled for launch in early 2021. Right now Capex is high due to this project but this will drive tremendous free cash flow if successful. Margins on their imagery results are 60.5%! https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview (https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview/)/

They received a $375M NASA contract to build part of NASA's Lunar Gateway, this clearly displays NASA's continued support and belief in MAXAR: http://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Maxar-Selected-to-Build-Fly-First-Element-of-NASAs-Lunar-Gateway/default.aspx

Value Speculation Side:

1. The industry is also rapidly growing and is expected to reach $3 Trillion in 30 years [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/the-space-industry-will-be-worth-nearly-3-trillion-in-30-years-bank-of-america-predicts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/the-space-industry-will-be-worth-nearly-3-trillion-in-30-years-bank-of-america-predicts.html)  
   
 

2.  Maxar wins $142 million NASA robotics mission, which means it could gain from NASA if the space competition being more active  
 [https://spacenews.com/maxar-wins-142-million-nasa-robotics-mission/](https://spacenews.com/maxar-wins-142-million-nasa-robotics-mission/)

Catalyst Side:

1. Strong Catalyst - Front Run Arkx

2. Said ARKK Avg P/E Ratio: 52.9 and Avg Price/Book Ratio: 15.31, this stock will range from $203 to $264

3. Short Interest 8.3%

Technical Side:

📷

1. Nice Volatility contraction recently, great range to accumulate in range.

2. In technical view, upside will be the highest of the triangle minus the lowest of the triangle times 2, which short term target will be $85 - $90

wallstreetbets,9547362,$PLTR Palantir Is BREAKING OUT To The Upside 🚀🚀🚀,m5ky3e,StonkmahnDouchenberg,1615815709,90,1,"Hey retards! Palantir is recovering from it’s downtrend, and starting to **breakout to the upside**. $PLTR has gone UP 19.42% from it’s March 8th low, after benefitting from buying by Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and other institutional players. If you take a look at the attached chart, it has broken through multi-month resistance and pierced the 20-day moving average. Why is it starting to run? Investors are realizing that it has a large and untapped Total Addressable Market (TAM) giving Palantir plenty of upside. 

Palantir operates two major adata-mining platforms, Gotham (for government) and Foundry (for commercial businesses). It **STARTED OUT** for being known for its highly secretive work with the federal government. Helping these high-profile government agencies go digital with their big data was a major tailwind for the company… but this isn’t why the stock price will **march to the upside**. The **NEXT MOVE** for the company is helping **commercial businesses** transition to the new artificial intelligence driven digital economy. 

In the era of businesses going virtual, Palantir will play a key role in allowing commercial businesses to process their big data with artificial intelligence, much like it has helped the US government do the same thing. Helping businesses make the best use of their big data assets is largely an untapped market. The Total Addressable Market for the company is $119 billion. This means that at a market penetration of less than 1%, Palantir has **room to go much higher**. Adding to this, the big data market will be worth $229.4 billion by 2025.

I'd pay attention to the following: 

1. Insider's lockup expiration date was February 19th - anyone who was going to sell **has** sold 

2. Chart is exhibiting a **breakout** from a multi-month downtrend and has penetrated the 20SMA 

3. Institutional buying includes Cathie’s $ARKK. Goldman Sachs **price target is $35**

4. In 4Q, Palantir signed 21 deals worth at least $5m in total contract value, including 12 deals each valued at $10m or more, many with **commercial customers** not government. The company is broadening its market to include commercial clients which represent about 10x their present Total Addressable Market. Revenue growth expected to be 4x in 5 years 

5. Low implied volatility on the options.

6. Many events coming up (DoubleClick Demo Day, Karp/Frost Interview) which will likely act as a catalyst for the stock. 

I’m long Jun 26c options. **I LIKE THE STONK**

Price Target: 

I believe there’s upside to the current average sell-side 2022 EPS estimates ($6.71 today, and I’m looking for $7-plus), but I’m reluctant to pay more than 14x-15x peak EPS, so $110 is about as high as I would go without a good argument for materially higher volumes in 2022 or 2023. My EV/EBITDA approach is based more on margins and returns (where PACCAR stands out positively), but at 11x my 2022 EBITDA estimate I get a fair value of around $105.

Over the past 6 weeks tech and growth have been slammed while ""value stocks"" like oil financials etc. have rallied. Congrats to those who made tendies off of that ride. I caught the tail end of it.

Now that the 10 year bond is yielding below 1.485, CNBC has finally given up on the fear mongering. I began looking at the short interest in 2 names in particular, AAPL and QQQ. Both of these names saw an increase in short interest to their highest levels in recent times. Essentially , because of their weighting, the yield story comes out and the 2 largest holdings in tech are shorted to the extreme bringing down the entire industry including ARKK etc.

Tuesday we saw a sharp rally to a major pivot point with the QQQ holding above $310. Yesterday this line was held and gave confirmation of a reversal. Today we see the breakout. I have every cent I own spread out amongst Q names. The DIA and SP have done great with the DIA seeing ATH. They will continue to perform but Tech and Growth are where you want to be til June IMO. If the shorts in the sector begin to cover, watch out.

My major holdings:

TQQQ

QQQ

LULU - Reports March 24th and a major growth name in the Q

AAPL

AMD - 2nd most shorted stock in dollar value next to Tesla

All these names have major runway and should perform well throughout the 2nd Qt. Inflation, Bond yields, ""economy crash"", stimmy checks. Everything is good news. Time to play the underperformers.

Tell Me How Retarded I Should Be,m2ktda,Kajavee,1615448476,3,1,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it’s a specific circumstance and you guys are idiots with short attention spans. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. This is fine for her since she has been buying since the 1970’s herself. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it literally paid for my entire college tuition.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk, volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is, I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (down 16% in 2 days along with you retards LFG):

Now for the advice - and please, no serious replies:

DEAL: Guaranteed $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of 2021, we will split any profits 50/50. 

I am looking to buy a house the beginning of 2022 so this is a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since this money is guaranteed anyways?

wallstreetbets,9382097,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (March 3, 2021 after market close)",lwcs10,freehouse_throwaway,1614719860,4,1,"* It's a seesaw market day as all indices attempts to find a clear direction after one of the best bull day in almost 9 months. Alas, after running up 5%+ on Monday, Tim Apple pare gains while Andy Amazon stayed relatively flat until power hour where big tech took a big dump. AAPL closed the day down -2% to $125 while AMZN closed down -1.64%, losing $3,100 yet again. Similar situation with FB at -2.23% and MSFta t -1.30%. With pressure from big bois and all sectors, QQQ/SPY sell off continued into closing hours.

* **RKT** is back on WSB menu after a long hiatus where it never fucking breaks the $22/$23 channel. Things changed yesterday as the largest mortgage lender in the US reported stellar Q4 numbers, with EPS at $1.14 vs consensus of $0.87. For once theta gang does NOT win on RKT even with an implied move of 18%+. Coupled with the special dividend announcement of $1.11 per share, short sellers are being extra squeezed today as shares ran as high as $36+ during intraday high. Despite floating around up 18% to 20% for the day, RKT started sky rocketing as it broke out the channel at 12:47 PM. After touching intraday high of +60%, RKT continued volatite trade with multiple halts as all OTM weeklies goes deep ITM. RKT closed the day up 71% with the rocket continuing in AH. Surely a new round of WSBer going into an ""old"" meme stock won't result in a new group of bagholders!? 

* **GME** continues to trade in a new channel with wild swing days as gamma exposure settles from MMs selling Feb options last week. F to the bro that bought way too many $800c 2/26 FDs last week. During intraday high GME was up ""modestly"" at +8% to $133 but gains faded towards end of day to close red at -1.84% to $118. The all-to-important Q4 earnings loom later this month on Wednesday March 24. 

* **ZM** reported earnings yesterday and while shares soar 9% AH, the gains didn't translate in open session today as shares fade and sold off towards end of day to close -9% at $372. Q4 EPS was $1.22 vs $0.79 consensus, and they project Q1 EPS of ~$0.97 vs consensus of $0.72 along with full year 2022 of ~$3.65, above consensus of $2.96. Price target was raised to $420 from $390 at Morgan Stanley while Piper Sandler upgrades the video conference company from neutral to overweight, with a PT of $541 (lol wtf). 

* **ARK Invest ETFs** traded flat today reflecting many of Cathie's holdings performances as of late (until power dump hour). Sent by Market Jebus himself, Cathie Woods has been dealing with a number of negative news round as chatters floats about of funds targetting her holdings as an attempt to push ARKK, ARKW and others down thanks to recent growth name weakness and a push on redemption - to which Cathie responded in bewildment that her ETF has plenty of liquidity and redemption is never an issue. With selling pressure from ROKU and TSLA, ARKK closed down -2.48% to $133 while ARKW closed down -2.34% to $164.

* **Notable upgrades and downgrades:** BYND, an old WSB meme, stock received an upgrade by Citi from Neutral to Buy. Shares close the day down -5% to $139. Cruise stocks receive an upgrade from Macquarie today with NCLH, RCL, CCL all upgraded to Outperform from Neutral today. On the downgrade side, PLUG took a hit from Barclays from Equal Weight to Underweight, while upping their PT to $29 (up from $21). The meme stock tok a dump today to close -7% to $48.73.

* In WSB meme stock land (okay what isn't a meme stock these days), **AMC** close the day down -2.72% to $8.93. Steel gang (I know you're still out there) are finally slowly crawling back from the depths of theta hell, with **MT** up +3.71%, finally breaking out of $25 once again. **BB** closed down -3.76%, staying in the $10 ranges for now until the next catalyst arrives.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** SNOW and OKTA reports today after market close. On Thursday before market opens: PRPL, and Michaels. After market close: COST, SDC, AVGO, GPS, and WORK. Heavily shorted Chinese education ""platform"" GSX reports Friday before market opens. Watch for TAL and EDU to move in sync with whatever GSX ends up reporting. (Both are good ER play candidate if you don't want to deal with the IV crush from GSX).

* **Notable econ numbers:** ADP employment at 8:15 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM. Jobless claims report at the usual Thursday 8:30 AM followed by factory orders and EIA at 10:30 AM. Finally, Fri brings us the employment situation with nonfarm payroll numbers at 8:30 AM Friday.

* The DOW closed down -0.46% or +144 pts, Nasdaq down -1.69% or -230 pts, SPX udown -0.81% or -31 pts, and RUT close down -1.93% or -43 pts. Our boi VIX is back in the spotlight again as its up 3.3% to 24+.

wallstreetbets,9316665,Unity - for the Crazy or for the Tanks? - Game Developer POV [$U],ls3ktz,CrazyTanks,1614248782,64,38,"So, here I'll gonna bring **my worthless POV on Unity**, but first of all - a 1 minute background:

**Unity is a game engine, which is the most important infrastructure of game making** \- before game engines appeared, game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves, then a lot of wrappers appeared (OpenGL, etc) and after that the game engines. The **game engine allows the developer to connect the code, graphics, music, physics, and basically everything together.**

Most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines. But as far as I concern, the only public, known, large and practically adopted by developers are Unity and Unreal Engine (we'll back to that shortly).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get back to Unity:

As a game developer (also ML/DL, but who cares), I've used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years, hell, I even used ""dark basic"" when I was young, and I can say that **Unity is the only time I felt at home**.

Now **I know you don't give a shit about my experience, so let's talk business**.

**The GOOD stuff:**

Unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and that's a FULLY CROSS PLATFORM ENGINE, that means that I can develop once, and **my stupid stuff would work PC, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, Virtual Reality, Web..**. You got the idea...  
That work of being cross platform is INSANELY HARD, which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product. Even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support, which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support.

TL;DR 1:  **Cross Platform**

Unity got a huge asset store, which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me, that means that even if I'm totally not profitable - Unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team.  
The huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform, and like Maya vs 3DSmax or Nikon vs Canon - the first one you've touched is gonna be the only one you'll know.

TL;DR 2: **Easy step in, huge asset store, revenues even from non-profitable games**

  
Next, the future. Game industry is growing and we all know it, but what Unity got that it would outperform the market? Glad you've asked, they got everything.  
Unity supports Machine Learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application - well that's too general right? So let me put it like that:  
3 years to the future, self driving cars are more and more popular and... regulated. When you regulate it you also have to test it - digitally. Unity is one of 2 (!) game engines that practically gonna be available for that task.  
Virtual Reality is also a trend - guess how most developers develop for it. Also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that.

TL;DR 3: **Tons of ""room to grow"" - VR, Algorithms and algorithms testing**

  
As I've mentioned, Unity got only one real competitor - Epic - which got  Unreal Engine that does basically the same. Epic are not public but hopefully will, but currently Unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product. If I had to choose, I would just put my Happy Hippos on both.

TL;DR 4: **No publicly traded competitors**  


Lastly, Unity can grow without a single phone call. There is no major difference for Unity to support 1K users or 1M (just like Google or Facebook) - if we compare it to companies like TTOW, Nintendo and even Xbox-Microsoft and Oculus (Facebook) - they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making.

TL;DR 5: **Unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user**

&amp;#x200B;

**Now for the BAD stuff:**

Unity price was very high, how much high? At the pick Unity passed EA (!) in terms of market cap. That's high.

It's currently at 35% discount right now, and it still might considered high - but do notice it's around 50%-60% more than IPO day (PLTR fore example is already multiplied - I think they were out on the same day).

TL;DR 6: **High Price (whatever that means...)**

Another bad thing - Unity had relatively bad quarter - their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative... Why is that? Well... first of all they've something like 750,000 shares, which is like 80M$ - that's exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter - you know what that means for the next one...

TL;DR 7: **Last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings - mostly due to stupid reasons**

As I've mentioned, large companies generally use their own game engines, that's a lot of money the currently Unity miss.

Lastly, Epic might go public sooner or later, it won't be a surprise if $U would go down some percents at the same day. But for the long run, ETFs would buy both of the stocks (like ARK/ARKK did with Unity) and that would bring the price up.

TL;DR 8: **Their only real competitor might go public sooner or later**

**That's it, if you survived everything tell me what you think.**

As many of you know, the world of cryptocurrency has become somewhat of a leading indicator in the equity markets. With Elon's purchase of digital currency as well as other fintechs such as SQ and PYPL that are deep holdings of ARKK, the share price of ARKK (which controls a lot of stakes in various companies) is inevitably now tied to digital coin prices. Thus, if coin prices were to fall through, it would create more downside pressure on TSLA and ARKK. Then, investors would start cashing out of ARKK, lowering ARKK's AUM and that will create a loop where ARKK has to sell shares across the board, which will create more downside pressure and it will create more drawdowns for the entire market. 

Thus, wall street has to support coin prices in order to make sure that TSLA and ARKK dont fall. Otherwise, the fact that this cryptocurrency is now an internal cog of fintech and TSLA as well as the fact that ARKK is now involved in so many different companies across the board will literally spell drawdowns for the entire market because of the fall of digital currency prices. In other words, the coin has now truly become the LEADING indicator of equity markets (especially in tech). As hedgefunds are leveraged in their tech positions, massive drawdowns in technology companies will force margin calls that will permeate to other assets such as value and commodities. This will in effect bring liquidations of other asset classes (similar to March 2020 liquidations in some ways). 

Unlike 2017 where digital coin was secluded from equity markets, 2021 is a different story where coins have become an internal cog of the markets because so many companies that are part of these ETFs have holdings in it. If we dont see wall street supporting it, we shall have a crash on our hands.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqtwx4/tslaarkk_can_bring_the_whole_house_down_unless_ws/,0.45

""Shut up gay bear!"" ""Don't short meme stocks!"" ""Cathy will bury you!"" Over the last year, you'd probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it's just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don't short SPY, short ARKK.

This is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it's up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it's performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what's happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since ""diversified"" by buying speculative ""growth stocks"" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.

&amp;#x200B;

So what? Well a number of Ark's holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla's meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark's tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy ""growth"" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK's price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK's price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark's illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target.

wallstreetbets,9180261,"ARKK gamma squeeze, low IV and premium. Cathie has potentially set herself up for a major correction after the last massive years run.",lojy2s,jim-and-pam,1613864804,166,0,"Alright BEAR with me kids as this is a lot to read(TLDR: buy ARKK puts) but as Jay Z told Rick Rubin, ‘You crazy for this one!’. I think I found a bubble within a bubble thats easier to gain on with the right catalyst.

Gamma squeezing ARKK is no simple task but the IV and premiums on the ETF are prime for some major tendies. I'm still building up the idea but I don't know if it's possible just due to the 'aunt Cathie' crowd. However, I decided to start a position on Friday and take one for the team.

Looking through ARKK weight on their top holds for the ETF, especially CRSP, PSTG, and NVTA could setup for major drop on certain tickers. 

CRSP they own 8.58% of open float and its 3.17% of their ETF
Short float is 4.60%

PSTG they own 7.86% of open float and its 2.04% of their ETF
Short float is 6.3%

NVTA they own 9.08% of open float and its 3.09% of their ETF
Short float is  16.26%

Other tickers that they own way to much of the float are PRLB(11.53%),IOVA(7.67%), TWST(6.80%), NTLA(10.90%), TWOU(11.65%), PD(9.37%), MTLS(10.75%), EDIT(10.62%), VCYT(7.23%), IRDM(5.49%), SSYS(12.05%), MCRB(9.54%), CERS(11.35%), CGEN(11.96%), SYRS(10.95%)

Large cap equities that stick out to me as a potential issue to front load their ETF on a pullback are TSLA, ROKU, SQ, TDOC, BIDU, SPOT, and Z where the current percentage of these equities in their ETF makes up 36.75% of their weight. I know they maintain the average weight of TSLA from 8-12% depending on the price action in order to maintain an average of 10% of the total ETF.

Though I'm not overly concerned with the weight of any major equity within their ETF, I am a bit concerned with the weight of the overall open float for many of their holdings. With a small correction in the tech and bio bubble they will definitely be the front runner in dumping.

The reason I am looking at ARKK in anticipation of a correction is that the IV and premium of puts is insanely low in comparison to the individual equities. It's hard to bet against ARKK since its cult like, but this is staying on my radar

I put together a table of the current shares on Friday close for ARKK that includes ARKK % of the float that they currently hold for the individual equity in their ETF and I highlight a few other key components such as Previous day average range, short float %, and ARKK current weight for each equity within their ETF.

PLTR's price action appears to be heavily influenced by shorts.

Fees were nominal ranging from 1% to 4%. 

You can see that today (not pictured) that, when shorts covered 3 million shares at market open today, the price recovered momentarily (false bull signal). 

Today the shorts have entered a fresh 3 million shares short position at the share price of around $25 with borrow fees in the mid 60%, betting that insiders will dump.

Unity is a software developer, and about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech. It took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it's been slowly bleeding as the market has remained down.
 
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, Cathie Woods has been steady in her support. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th (at around $130/share). Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128, and now 116. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity. I fully expect it to return to at least 130 in a couple of weeks.

I  had been living in Taiwan for the past 3 years, one thing i noticed is  Taiwanese people are very heavily influenced by the US. I also believe  the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a  position where it semi depends on the US. With China's economy booming,  the US did not want to give up their baby TSM. They banned TSM, from  making HiSilicon chips for Huawei. I wonder why?

TSM  also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex, to hopefully  expand and meet the demand. A plant in Arizona, should also help the  American companies who rely on TSM heavily.

Being my first post, any feedback would be much appreciated.

I had been living in Taiwan for the past 3 years, one thing i noticed is Taiwanese people are very heavily influenced by the US. I also believe the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a position where it semi depends on the US. With China's economy booming, the US did not want to give up their baby TSM. They banned TSM, from making HiSilicon chips for Huawei. I wonder why? 

TSM also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex, to hopefully expand and meet the demand. A plant in Arizona, should also help the American companies who rely on TSM heavily. 

  
Being my first post, any feedback would be much appreciated.

1. PLTR conference call &gt; hiccup in share price &gt; surprise Q4 EPS and optimism of founders not selling shares (🙌💎)

2.  TSXV: H⚡I⚡V⚡E  (did that for obvious reasons) is seeing huge gains in volume and share price.  Lots of talk about the new BC technology and with this whole it could go to 400k I could see others following suit.  Need to learn more about this one:  http://imgur.com/gallery/p1MSs10

3. Buying some shares of these 2 with orders tonight as shown:  http://imgur.com/gallery/C3nPOJN
Thinking both of these are really cutting edge, have had great weeks and are ARK hot handed profitmakers.  Just hope those guys make a killing like last year.

4.  Weed stocks rebounding. Sold a canopy growth  today for good tendies to double up on the dip from PLTR (yolo) (team aphria + h3cks-0h for now)

5. Looking to collect high dividends from these energy stocks and put them all into some ark funds (arkg arkk arkq arkw) 

symbol: dividends % (differ quarterly or semi annual)
ENB: 7.57% 
BP: 5.44%
EPD: 8.21%
BNS: 5.05%
CPG: 0.24% (good returns on hedging)

I know I sound like a financial adviser but I can assure you I'm not.  I'm probably alot more retarded then most of you but that's besides the point.  I would recommend some of you dumbasses snag a couple high dividends stocks and recover from your loses.  I would have have a ultra rare return rate of over 50 percent on ALL my investments from mid November til now if I didn't throw random cash at AMC NOK and others (lucky I had BB at 7ish bucks so that was a win)  long story short you autists: do your own dd and if you lose you can only blame yourself.  It is funny to lose a big amount of money but recovering from it is funny too.  

All I say is have some backup divs and stuff in SAFER stocks.  I know I sound like a pussy but you can always have your risky cash and your safe cash (to bail you out of risky cash plays)

wallstreetbets,8980242,🚀🚀🚀 QQQJ to rocket even more over the next two weeks 🚀🚀🚀,lii20e,LaPulgaAtomica87,1613156502,6,1,"TLDR: QQQJ will rocket over the next two weeks because some of its major companies like \*\*ETSY, ROKU, VIAC, TTD, ZS, BILI\*\* will be reporting earnings starting next week.  


I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something ""safer"" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.

5) Why will it rocket even more in the next two weeks? Well the following companies will be reporting earnings: ROKU (18 Feb), TTD (18 Feb), ETSY (25 Feb), VIAC (24 Feb), BILI (24 Feb), ZS (25 Feb)

6) Call me conspiratorial but I believe market makers and hedge funds have been using WSB for their pump and dump schemes since we blew up. It's not impossible but it is harder to pump and dump an ETF. So I believe that makes QQQJ safer and more robust than some of the other plays circulating on here.

I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!  


My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months. But as always, do your own DD folks and be skeptical of everything you read (including this!!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lii20e/qqqj_to_rocket_even_more_over_the_next_two_weeks/,1.0

wallstreetbets,10597792,Lets talk about BABA. Again.,o8sgmo,gtsui,1624779663,29,1,"Reposting this cause my last one got deleted for some reason.m:

Alright listen up you retarded apes. After this weeks move its time we revisit BABA.

First my personal thoughts on why the move: everybody and their mother knows BABA is fundamentally undervalued but have been staying on the sidelines like scared little bitches because of some vague China fears. Same thoughts are running on the institutional side and majority of hedge funds being the sheep they are, they’re all afraid to act first and pull the trigger. With the public news of ARKK and a couple other funds buying up BABA and other Chinese stocks this has finally signaled to the other hedgies that its okay to invest in China and now theyre all trying to pile back in at the same time. Institutional FOMOs gonna drives this beast back up.

So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next:

1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.
2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLO’ing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.
3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABA’s operating profits on their cloud computing arm Alicloud. They’ve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far they’ve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a huge cash cow with big profits low costs that’ll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.
4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other value investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too.

For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late still. My guess is there’ll probably be a pullback next week so you apes have a window to get in before its too late. I know I’ll be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with.

Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here.

So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next:

1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.
2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLO’ing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.
3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABA’s operating profit on Alicloud. They’ve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far they’ve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a cash cow that’ll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.
4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other value investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too.

For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late still. My guess is there’ll probably be a pullback next week so you apes have a window to get in before its too late. I know I’ll be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with.

Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here.

Tl;dr buy some BABA if you want to make money you fking retards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o86npm/lets_talk_about_baba_again/,1.0

# Intro

Since reaching a high of $74 in March, $DKNG 🦍 has tumbled to a current share price of $48. I believe this represents an incredible opportunity to get in on a stock ticker with a proven track record of making huge gains. I missed DKNG's initial runup in 2020 because I was skeptical of each new ATH, but last week's Hindenburg report got me taking another look at the company and I love what I see. Now, one week later, I've finally finished my DD and am ready to present it to the class.

**Sit down for your weekly shit and get ready, this DD is a fucking deep dive.**

# TL;DR:

* Analyst 12 month target is $68.85.
* IV is 52 (3% percentile rank), so options are incredibly cheap.
* Revenue is through the roof and growing fast.
* Customer acquisition has been extremely successful.
* Short interest actually *fell* after the Hindenburg report.
* The market hasn't fully priced in some major legalizations that could be coming soon.
* Investors know DraftKings isn't going to stay at this valuation for long, so they consider it on sale.
* Cathie Wood BTFD and are you really going to second guess the bull queen?

# An Overview of DraftKings

Before I start, I'd like to point out that Investopedia has a page on how daily fantasy sites work that I highly recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/d87mp52cnv671.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f57feef548f8f946901c2e061d14ce467574fe

DraftKings started as a daily fantasy sports app. If sports betting is illegal in your state, you can't place a bet on whether the Packers will beat the over. But, through DraftKings, you *can* select players from the Packers for a temporary fantasy football team and then play that team in tournaments for money. This is because most states consider fantasy sports a game of skill and not gambling. But, basically, it's a loophole that allows a roundabout form of sports betting.

In 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal sports wagering ban, and that same year DraftKings released DraftKings Sportsbook, which allows users to place sports bets through an app in states where online betting is legal. The company is looking to leverage first-mover advantage and name recognition to become the predominant betting company in the United States by capitalizing on the mobile market. DraftKings Sportsbook isn't only available through the app, though. They also already have retail locations in states like New York and Mississippi - where retail betting is legal but online isn't.

https://preview.redd.it/jtzsm9bfnv671.jpg?width=988&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00d619228b01dacd782b2c92c104a48e85b00872

The DraftKings U.I. is easy to use, and the fact that it's on your mobile phone creates a disconnect in the user from the actual cost of gambling. It's the same reason Robinhood was able to create a retail investing revolution - the human brain is not good at fully weighing the risks of gambling when it's just numbers on a screen as opposed to money in your hand. Same reason casinos use chips - it provides a mental separation between the gambler and his money. Except this mental separation is about ten times as large.

Warren Buffet famously said ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand."" In other words, invest in what you know. There's a reason he bought Dairy Queen after all. Personally, I have been using DraftKings for daily fantasy for a few years now, ever since a fantasy football league mate turned me onto it. Since then, almost every single one of my leaguemates uses DraftKings during the fall/winter. If online betting were legal in our state, I'm sure we'd all be using their sportsbook too. **Think about it, DraftKings (and FanDuel) have essentially created a gateway app to a gambling addiction via daily fantasy sports.**

# The Legalization Of Betting

This is huge. Since 1992 sports betting has been illegal in most of the U.S. But after the Supreme Court's ruling in May 2018:

* 13 states have legalized online betting.
* 7 others legalized betting at retail locations, but have yet to legalize online betting.
* 8 more states are expected to finalize legalization of some form of sports betting in 2021.

**That means over half the country has legalized betting in just three years.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lni8l92nnv671.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae473c90c52910946d0ba5a549bd61557eb34770

Still, the future of sports gambling will be heavily influenced by three states which have yet to legalize - Florida, Texas, and California. These three states alone represent over 27% of the entire U.S. population.

1. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a new compact with the Seminole Tribe that would bring statewide mobile wagering, although betting won't begin until at least mid October. It is anticipated that DraftKings will be able to at least secure a pari-mutuel contract with the Seminole.
2. Texas had a sports betting bill submitted this year, but it likely won't be considered until the 2022 legislative session. There are no legal casinos in Texas, so it's expected that Texan gambling would include an online component.
3. The L.A. Times reported last month that California voters will decide on November's 2022 ballot whether to allow sports betting. It's uncertain if the measure will tether betting to tribal casinos like some other states, or whether it will also allow online wagers.

# Revenue, Earnings, and Outlook

**DraftKings is experiencing rapid revenue growth, with one ARK analyst stating the firm believes sports betting revenues will be 18x by 2025.** Q1 2021 earnings were 312m, an incredible *252.69%* year-over-year increase. That revenue figure beat analyst projections by a thicc fucking 32%.

Below is a chart comparing DKNG with some other growth stocks that were hot in 2020. Keep in mind these operate in a variety of industries and sectors, so you shouldn't just make a 1:1 comparison. But it can help provide some context for DKNG's metrics.

&amp;#x200B;

||Projected 2022 Revenue|Projected 2022 Earnings Per Share|P/E (12M FWD)|Cash Per Share|Total Debt to Equity|LFCF|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DKNG|1.62B|(1.61)|(25.97)|7.03|57.18|82.89M|20.11B|

|PENN|5.87B|2.41|31.5|13.23|405.85|626.92M|11.9B|

&amp;#x200B;

If EPS didn't immediately jump out at you then you're right at home on WallStreetBets. Despite incredible revenue growth, DKNG has had abysmal EPS showings. In Q1 2021, they reported a loss of $0.87 per share, which was *60%* worse than analyst estimates. 

So how does this company that boasts massive revenue growth manage to lose so much money?Advertising and customer acquisition costs. *Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming* estimated similar company FanDuel's spends about $68 per daily fantasy sports customer acquired. However, they also estimated that FanDuel made $100 *per season* off each acquired customer. So the upfront cost is big, but the profit margin is about 47% the first year *and then 100% each season after that*. 

DraftKings is competing against FanDuel and Barstool Sportsbook to become the industry leader in the new world of online betting, so the customer acquisition cost of sportsbook gamblers is likely at least twice as much. But DKNG *has* to be aggressive to immediately establish themselves as the premier sportsbook among new gamblers, and being aggressive means spending money. So far - it's been very successful.

https://preview.redd.it/7kiby2sxnv671.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dce1d5cedfbe14e31f93d838c67c3317ec35889

**In Q1 2021, Monthly Unique Payers (MUPs) increased 114% year-over-year**, which was about a 60% larger growth rate than projected. This means the aggressive approach is working; and while it costs a lot to acquire a user, once you have them you have them for years. Unlike costs such as website upkeep, user acquisition can be scaled back eventually, which means DraftKings is expected to translate their massive revenue into monster earnings by decade's end. For now, it's a great sign that the company is locking people into a lifetime gambling addiction.

# Limiting Factors

**Hindeburg Report:**

https://preview.redd.it/1vogba03pv671.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de5b03f7b048e0c956728876baa56cffb99a8bc

Let's finally get the big flaming blimp in the room out of the way. On 6/15/2021, Hindenburg Research published a reasearch note titled, ""DraftKings -  A $21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations."" Hindenburg's most notable allegation is that SBTech, a Bulgarian company that merged with DraftKings as part of it's SPAC process, generates roughly half their (SBTech's) revenue from markets where gambling is banned.

I can't believe this even requires addressing. SBTech's revenue accounts for a tiny portion of DraftKings' total operations. Who gives a fuck about this? Certainly not investors. Besides the fact that Hindenburg's allegations are poorly (read: not at all) sourced, DKNG has seen it's stock price soar because of U.S. legalization, not because of SBTech's operations.

Additionally, Hindenburg states that insider selling is a bearish sign. Fuck off. The stock rose over 300% in 2020, every corporation on the planet would have insiders who take profit after a run up like that. News flash - insiders selling for massive gains isn't a bad thing.

[If you want to read a more complete takedown of the Hidenburg allegations, I'd recomment this post.](https://nr.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o15i7b/an_investigation_hindenburg_research_dkng/)

**The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act**

https://preview.redd.it/xnat3yv6pv671.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfa62cc33a6afb4db682a819e01bed72bb687f04

In 1988, the United States passed a federal law to govern Native American casinos and such, marking the first federal gaming structure. Since the federal ban on sports betting was struck down in 2018, many states have been hesitant to upset their tribal lobbies by legalizing online betting. And some legislators (whether true or only claimed) believe that legalizing online betting would violate the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA).

Tribes have successfully lobbied in several states to limit sports betting to their established retail casinos. As somebody who lives in one of these states, I feel confident saying that this does not adequately service consumer demand. So it's almost a given that some states will expand their laws at some point to allow online betting. *How many* states is a big question.

A lot of analysts that I've seen write/speak about the coming widespread legalization of betting don't seem to fully understand the legal framework that could still limit DraftKings' expansion. The best case scenario may be for betting to be once again challenged in court - this time either going after the IGRA or filing an anti-trust lawsuit against the tribes.

I personally think DraftKings will have online betting available in the majority of states by the end of the decade, but it is *not* a given like many analysts believe. Just because betting is legalized doesn't mean DraftKings Sportsbook will be legal.

# Analysts and Investors Love DKNG

Use some common fucking sense - this generation loves to gamble. You're literally reading this on a subreddit devoted to betting. The big market investors know this and are getting in early for when every other male between the ages of 25 and 60 is spending 5% of their paycheck on March Madness and Football parlays.

https://preview.redd.it/31a9kj6spv671.png?width=271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8052b6bf69e9b73e89aa455b7bf52c709d6d6a6f

Here's a direct quote from an ARK Invest analyst:

&gt;When we first started looking at the online sports betting space, the realization we came to is this is a supply and demand issue in that there is definitely a ton of consumer demand but the supply has been held up by regulation; and I would just add there that regulation is starting to favor more and more online sports betting. So when you look at it as just a supply and demand issue this is definitely still very much the early days.  
&gt;  
&gt;This \[past\] year was absolutely disastrous for sports. You had the cancellation of tournaments, you had shortened seasons. But what we actually saw was an enormous growth in online sports betting... \[The\] 18 billion \[dollars in total bets handled\] breaks down to around 1 billion in total revenue for 2020. **We expect that to almost 18x, in terms of - we're going to go from 1 billion in revenue in 2020 to almost 18 billion in revenue by 2025.**

Investors know that while customer acquisition cost is high, it's an upfront payment you make in order to acquire a lifetime customer in a high revenue industry. **If you think full legalization will bring a lot of new customers, wait until 2030 - when today's teenagers will have real jobs and start betting their paychecks on the bourgeoning e-sports scene.** I know that seems like a long time away, *but* the market won't wait until 2030 to start pricing that in.

https://preview.redd.it/f52ayiltqv671.png?width=1407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0cca98572260a87c6410769747bfe749f692bca

Speaking of which, what exactly is the market pricing in right now? Based on my projections, the current market cap is pricing in 7.5B in revenue, max. **So if investors reach a consensus that aggressive analysts like ARK are right and revenue will grow to 18B, a market cap of 50B would make more sense. That's $125 a share, or a 250% increase.**

So why has the price fallen 34% since March? The most likely answers are two factors:

1. Profit taking after the huge runup in 2020.
2. The giant miss on Q1 2021 earnings.

While the earnings miss likely scared away some investors who were hoping for a profitable business within the next few years, most are in it for the long haul. I know that if I was long on shares, I frankly wouldn't give a single shit about the earnings. I like to see the company being aggressive and spending money to dominate a giant growth industry from the go - especially when acquisition has been so incredibly successful. That should mean huge profits in the next decade.

This stock seems to have fantastic support around the level it's at now. Granted, it did kiss $40 in May, but it rebounded back to $55 within two weeks. It should be telling that Mama Cathie bought another 870k shares the same day as the Hindenburg dip, and ARKK alone has added about 10M shares in total since March. **Growth minded investors consider DKNG on sale right now.**

https://preview.redd.it/6kwsennzqv671.png?width=1729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd58282aff34b87e387800692c1e1a0dd9827fc3

""Bu - but what about the short seller report? Aren't there a bunch of investors driving the price down after Hindenburg's research?"" Nope. Luckily for you, I paid $600 for an ORTEX subscription so I can give you the inside scoop on shorting.

**ORTEX estimates that short interest has actually fallen since the Hindenburg report.** Yes, you read that right. Short Interest before the report was estimated at 7.86%. Now it's estimated at 7.36%. That's almost a 10% decrease in shorting. Thanks, Hindenshit; you morons.

# Plays, Position and Price Targets

**There's three plays that make sense to me:**

1. Options are cheap, so you could choose something medium length to capitalize on football season hype. 10/15 $60c are trading at $2.90 with a lot of open interest. Sell when the price hits $70 again and you should get at least a quad-bagger. Take note though, there's no guarantee football hype will be enough to drive the price above your break even point. If you felt really risky, 10/15 $80c are $0.85. If the price hits $70 before the theta decay hits too hard (like, next month), you could potentially make a ten bagger.
2. My personal play is LEAPS. 1/20/2023 $60c are $11.55. You've got plenty of time to let the stock consolidate and rally again. This option leaves time for plenty of big catalysts to pop the price - such as new legalizations, football season, March Madness, and revenue growth. A share price of $100 should net you a quad-bagger (maybe a lot more depending on how soon it happens).
3. Shares is a great option here. It mitigates you from a ton of risk in this play. Set it and forget it. Come back in 2025 and find that your shares are worth three times as much.

# What is SKLZ?

“Skillz is a San Francisco based **online mobile multiplayer video game competition platform** that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use it to compete in competitions against other players across the world”

What they are actually trying to say is that they are using casino style mechanics in their games by replacing the **“chance”** element with “**skill**”. This means that every time you want to compete in a game, you pay **60 cents** up front.

The company went the special purpose acquisition route in 2020 and quickly got picked up by our favourite gambler and stock-picker, **Cathie Wood** from **ARK Invest**, and thrown into her ARKK &amp; ARKW funds **(15.5 million shares in ARKK and 7.5 million shares in ARKW to be exact)**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4n18gccyoo671.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a3f7b07e5fcae30191b7c6efe7cba670224f7f0

The innovative part about Skillz is that they are not actually a game developer, but rather provide a tech platform that connects mobile gamers and game developers. As mentioned, gamers pay an entry fee and have the chance to win more. Think of it like the future of mobile games being powered by highly addictive gambling technology.

Their business model slide shows it in a neat way

https://preview.redd.it/pgohk981po671.png?width=1392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2d296bcf3a49590c6d45b60f82cf0658c7658a

# Why are they being shorted, and what's the bear case.

The bear case is actually much easier on this one. They are making a couple hundred million in revenue, but nowhere near enough to justify such a high market cap. At the moment, their pricey forward P/S implies extreme future growth.

On top of that, they were targeted by a securities class action lawsuit 3 months ago, regarding some statements they made in their public offering prospectus. I personally think that this lawsuit doesn’t have too much merit since it looks like a classic case of a law firm trying to find a case and make a quick buck. Trying to get some poor schmuck 1.70$ back on their SPAC purchase isn’t really going to have a long term impact on anything.

# Why could they have a massive upswing?

Unlike most shorted companies which are completed cash strapped, in debt and struggling to survive another day, Skillz has a very strong balance sheet, including **$ 613 million in cash**. You can get most of the important bits out of their Q1 earnings presentation, but one nice way to summon up their potential is the following quote:

*“Skillz is a technology platform, and its* ***profit potential is off the charts.*** *It's not developing games, it's providing the space that brings gamers and developers together. In the third quarter of 2020, the company's gross margin was* ***94.8%****, and it was* ***95.5%*** *through the first three quarters of 2020. These flashy numbers suggest that Skillz can leverage revenue growth into substantial cash flow.”.*

Their growth numbers and margin is *very* *good,* and the business model is a sneaky way to circumvent gambling laws. The technology is solid, and good enough to make it into the ARK funds.

I would suggest everyone to have a good look at their [IR presentation here](https://investors.skillz.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx) to also understand their business better and have that same **f#ck yes** moment that I had, before dropping a big wad of cash on them.

**By June25th they will be added to the Russell 3000, meaning every ETF with exposure to Russell 3000 will load up on shares, starting July.**

Apart from Russell 3000 and Cathie, the stock already has a very large following on Stocktwits with people trading it up and down.

# What's the price action?

Skillz went live at $10.26 and managed to shoot up to $43. Since then, they took a nose dive with more and more people started shorting it, until it hit $12.55 in April 2021 before quickly recovering and creating a double bottom around $19-20. The current short interest hovers around 30% with roughly 71 million shares sold short. I think at this price it’s a fantastic time to buy in and give the shorts a little pinch.

Having cash on hand, they just announced this month the acquisition of Aarki, to form the First Integrated Esports Advertising Platform. *“Aarki is described as a leading technology-driven marketing platform that engages in more than 5T monthly advertising auctions. Aarki uses data engines and proprietary machine learning algorithms to deliver ROI for performance advertisers.”*

Now why is this awesome? With Aarki, they can aggressively widen their footprint in the mobile gaming industry and turn the monetization to another level. This is however long term stuff that will take time to play out, with the acquisition happening towards Q4.

# How could this be a YOLO?

The bear case is way overdone and 71 million shorts is quite a lot given the company has cash on hand and good margins. The price heavily fluctuates, giving excellent entry and exit points + aggressive pops when shorts have to cover. The addition to the Russell 3000 could drive the price way up and if retail sentiment stays high

The only downside is though that the IV is quite high. The stock could be at 30 in a month, 40, or back down at 10$. Options are expensive unless they are OTM.

I decided to drop in with $5000 in shares today, looking overall for an **100 - 300 % return. (link in comments).**

# What is Skillz?

“Skillz is a San Francisco based online mobile multiplayer video game competition platform that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use it to compete in competitions against other players across the world” (and make or lose money).

To me, that actually sounds like that they took the classic casino mechanics and replaced the **“chance”** element with “**skill**” (although you still have the chance to win big, if you are skilled enough). The company went the special purpose acquisition route in 2020 and quickly got picked up by our favourite gambler and stock-picker - **Cathie Wood** from **ARK Invest**, and thrown into her ARKK &amp; ARKW funds **(15.5 million shares in ARKK and 7.5 million shares in ARKW to be exact)**. 

The innovative part about Skillz is that they are not actually a game developer, but rather provide a tech platform that connects mobile gamers and game developers. On top of that, gamers pay an entry fee and have the chance to win more. Think of it like the future of mobile games being powered by the biggest Texas Hold’em gambling style tournament. 

Their business model slide shows it in a neat way

# Why are they good?

Unlike most shorted companies which are completed cash strapped, in debt and struggling to survive another day, Skillz has a very strong balance sheet, including $ 613 million in cash. You can get most of the important bits out of their Q1 earnings presentation, but one nice way to summon up their potential is the following quote:

 *“Skillz is a technology platform, and its profit potential is off the charts. It's not developing games, it's providing the space that brings gamers and developers together. In the third quarter of 2020, the company's gross margin was 94.8%, and it was 95.5% through the first three quarters of 2020. These flashy numbers suggest that Skillz can leverage revenue growth into substantial cash flow.”.*

I would suggest everyone to have a good look at their [IR presentation here](https://investors.skillz.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx) to also understand their business better and have that same **f#ck yes** moment that I had, before dropping a big wad of cash on them.

# Why are they bad and shorted?

Well, their pricey forward P/S implies extreme future growth (something they still gotta materialise) and they were targeted by a securities class action lawsuit 3 months ago, regarding some statements they made in their public offering prospectus. I personally think that this lawsuit doesn’t have too much merit since it looks like a classic case of a law firm trying to find a case and make a quick buck. We know that there are many law firms who are making all sorts of legal accusations against many companies every day. That’s just how they tick. Trying to get some poor schmuck 1.70$ back on their SPAC purchase isn’t really gonna have a long term impact on anything. 

# Price action since inception?

Skillz went live at $10.26 and managed to shoot up to $43. Since then it took a nose dive with more and more people started shorting it, until it hit $ 12.55 in April 2021 before quickly recovering and creating a double bottom around $19-20. The current short interest hovers around 30% with roughly 71 million shares sold short. I think at this price it’s a fantastic time to buy in and give the shorts a little pinch. 

I decided to drop in with $5000 in shares today, looking overall for an 100 - 300 % return.

# How could this be a YOLO?

Looking at the previous price actions of meme stocks, a couple things were always present. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. People did their own DD, really liked the stock and outright bought shares
2. The companies were highly shorted dynamite barrels just waiting for a match to fall
3. And of course many degenerates bought way OTM lotto calls, forcing market makers to buy up shares to hedge their own positions and creating massive gamma squeezes

&amp;#x200B;

Since Skillz heavily fluctuates in price, shares are probably preferred. As mentioned above, I went in with $5000 just on shares, and will load on more if we see good movement through the 20-30 price. ITM calls are priced OK here, but there are plenty of cheaper Moonshots available at **30, 35** and **40**. 

The good thing is that the stocktwits-retards have a hard one for this one too (can’t blame them with that kind of price action) so any movement made here is amplified.  

I hope this was interesting to some of you who prefer straight up YOLOs.

 \- Since before the first ape, our fates have been inextricably linked with our poop, and it's about time for a breakthrough in poop technology.   
\- There's a popular saying with holistic medicine types, 'food is medicine'. Food becomes poop. Ergo, poop is medicine.     
\- Our poop is entering a new age of technological progress and Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is the clear leader in the multi-billion dollar opportunity of poop-based medicine, with catalyzing data coming in the next few weeks. The McRib is back in a big way.   
Smart apes also use tools. Having capitalized on their first milestone, [taking 35k to 270k in options](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2rgii/35k_to_270k_betting_on_literal_poop_in_2020_round/), this formerly broke as shit ape used modern statistical methods to construct conservative quantitative risk models for the next phase of development in poop technology, with the results validating continuing to go full ape mode YOLO on MCRB.     
MCRB is overwhelmingly likely to double to previous highs on new data in a pivotal breakthrough indication (ulcerative colitis), with further long term growth potential in oncology, inflammation, immunity, and more. They are also having an investor day presentation today [here](https://ir.serestherapeutics.com/events/event-details/seres-therapeutics-investor-event).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5cj1eqaxl671.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a617097a6d8d2325c41f9d8af0dc5caad0cfb6

**Abstract**   
Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is a Cathie Wood Approved™ microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs. Their therapy for SER-109 in persistent bacterial GI infection (C. Diff) is nearing approval after a successful Phase 3, demonstrating that the company can deliver on less complicated applications for the technology and has the process and manufacturing to address more lucrative indications. Phase 2 of clinical trials is a pivotal de-risking milestone and is typically where most of the value of a clinical stage asset is realized. The upcoming readout for SER-287 in ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a substantial growth opportunity for MCRB, more than doubling the potential addressable market size. Published disease response rates were evaluated to construct a quantitative risk model in [PYMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/about.html), which shows a very high likelihood (\~88%) of positive results under stringent assumptions. Prior readout timelines and public statements about results “mid-year” point to announcement in July, gapping share price to ATH (\~38$). The hype cycle may have come and gone on the microbiome field \~2015, but the addressable markets are just getting ready for the disruption and Seres will lead the pack.  
**Significance/Innovation**    
If you don't think poop is an opportunity for cutting-edge health care technology, all it takes is constant bleeding out of your asshole to change that perspective. Chron's and Ulcerative colitis are miserable chronic illnesses, and apes are already paying out the ass for approved drugs with unreliable effectiveness. Modifying the gut microbiome is a highly effective 'black box' approach that has had a lot of development in basic, animal, and translational research. Changing gut microbial composition affects multiple disease pathways in a manner superior to current targeted drugs for complex pathologies. In the MCRB trial, 3 groups of 67 patients (Placebo, low dose, high dose) with mild/moderate UC failing standard of care (5-ASA, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory) were treated for 10 weeks and evaluated by endoscopy for response and remission. Placebo and drug effect sizes can be reliably modeled using available data, so risk of failure is well defined, and the company has been consistent on readout timelines of 7-9 weeks after completion.     
    
**The computer says 'YOLO'**   
To model trial success and failure probabilities in PyMC3, I reviewed published recurrence rates in randomized, controlled clinical trials of mild-moderate UC and estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals. For placebo, I used recent trials from a meta-analysis paper [(Jairath 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483671/), Mean: 88%, 95% CI: 91%-85%. FMT trials are much less consistent in treatment and design further demonstrating need for standardized, approved therapy, so I used a conservative estimate from several studies notably [Costello 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2720727?resultClick=1), M: 73%, CI: 70%-76%. Treated recurrence was taken from prior Phase I SER-287 trial and placebo meta-analysis CI, M: 60%, CI: 57%-63% ([Henn 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402096/)).   
These estimates were used to model distribution of patient-level treatment effect for the 67 Placebo and High Dose patients. PYMC3 was used to model the recurrence rate as binomial distributions, individual treated patient Bernoulli trials were further challenged by mixing at a 0.8 probability with 0.1 placebo response and 0.1 FMT recurrence rates.     
After patient-level draws are made for each iteration of the trial simulation, I then address the possibility that the treatment effect is statistically valid (p&lt;0.05), but still marginal enough that analysts shit on it and we don't get our moon mission.  I do this by imposing an additional hurdle of &gt;10% group difference in recurrence to qualify as a pass (e.g., if placebo recurrence is 60/67 (\~90%), treated group must be 53/67 or less to qualify). After hitting the magic inference button a few times and tuning the sampler hyper-parameters, a few key posterior predictions/probability density functions are: mixed patient-level recurrence probability (failure, UC flares up again within 10 weeks, a), total recurrences at the Treated Group level (b), and empirical trial failure probability after applying the 10% cut-off for difference in % remission (c). 

https://preview.redd.it/eyyhxwq5zl671.png?width=4989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b146f52c8076f05afc853310e0b714fb6ef375ef

**Business logic**  
Assessing risk also involves understanding the non-public information and decision making behind the scenes. Interim/partial data analysis is standard practice for clinical trials, how a company uses this early evaluation of at the data is highly informative. This part is also a bit of Bayesian logic, but this time we're doing it in our heads. Previously, Seres Therapeutics demonstrated that they will use an early stopping option to discontinue trials that are not likely to succeed (ECOSPOR II), saving them time, money, and effort. They've also never blown their load by publishing a positive interim readout like some companies, choosing not to disclose data from the successful repeat of ECOSPOR II at all. We've long since passed the early stopping point for this trial, so we can conclude that the internal information points towards success. Management has demonstrated they are science-first and don't play games with the stock price by manipulating disclosures. I have extreme confidence in the company leadership and development approach, they have been diligent and systematic about forward progress so far and I expect that to continue. 

**Conclusion**   
The risk model is very conservative, a significant proportion of patients could end up non-responders and low-responders and the trial remains a success with room to spare. The risk/reward ratio is off the charts and timing remains the largest source of uncertainty.

wallstreetbets,10560346,Market Perspective: Recent Trends and Performance in Charts,o4d2vf,_foldLeft,1624217375,19,1,"Strap in, this is gonna be a long one. A lot happened this week, yet despite all the turmoil the SPY closed down less than %3 on the week, IWM a little worse off at under %4 and QQQ about unchanged. As we’ll discuss, there’s a different story lurking beneath the surface and it’s questionable just how much this volatility can be contributed to the Fed’s comments on Wednesday.

####Fed Reaction

At the risk of being labelled a Fed apologist, I have to ask what were people expecting? Those recently screeching about inflation risks should be happy: [the Fed has taken note](https://www.ft.com/content/0bf83e29-5ee2-415e-9e03-0edb38218bf3), though sticking to the narrative (seemingly supported by the bond market) that it’s transitory, they are guiding for possible rate hikes in 2023, two years from now. Though this view could change in the coming months as supply chain issues resolve and data “normalizes”, this recent adjustment in guidance shows that the Fed seems to be acknowledging current data and willing to quickly adjust it’s long-term view.  
Like, what more do you people want? This is not a bad thing, and given their current intention is to create some inflation (but not too much), I think they’ve been dead-on in their approach.

####Market Reaction

From a market perspective we had two catalysts this week: the Fed notes on Wednesday and a [quarterly Opex on Friday that involved a massive gamma roll-off](https://spotgamma.com/quad-witching-gamma-pinning/). Both caused noise in the markets and I think it’s important to understand what affected what in order to have an understanding of what to watch in the next week or two.  
To do so, we’ll need to look at the reflation trade that’s recently been in vogue, bonds, and index action.

So, let’s dive in to the charts…

#Charts

Sector Performance  


[Sector Compare 1y]()

[Sector Compare 1m]()  


The last week has marked a significant downturn in certain sectors, specifically those of the reflation trade: XLI, XLF, XLE, IWM all took big hits this week. Zooming in on the chart adds to this story: since the volatility in mid-May they’ve been flat and underperforming with downward momentum picking up into June. All that time, unprofitable growth stocks (represented by ARKK) have been on the up. 

####Reflation Trade Breakdown?  


[XLF 1y]()

[XLI 1y]()

[BCI 1y]()

[IWM 1y]()

For a few weeks now the reflation trade has seemingly stalled. Wednesday and Thursday, quite obviously attributed to the Fed’s commentary, this trade had a major breakdown. Commodities, represented by BCI, which tracks the Bloomberg Commodities / BCOM index, sold off alongside major reflation themes in financials and industrials. Energy slid as well, and IWM (small caps) followed through on that failed breakout. 

Looking to bonds, US10Y yields shot up post-announcement and then came right back down:

[TNX 5d]()

But, the action in the 30Y/5Y spreads is what’s most telling, as they got absolutely hammered (flattened) indicating that _“…investors are pulling back on expectations of inflation remaining sticky and are beginning to price in a more benign inflation outlook in line with the Fed’s forecast of a transitory or temporary increase in inflation…”_ (source is marked as spam):

[US30Y less US05Y]()

So suddenly the market is realizing the Fed is actually going to react to continued “bad” data (inflation-wise; exactly what we mentioned above) and is pricing that in.

####Opex Volatility

Contrary to the action above, SPY and QQQ held up Wednesday into Thursday and then had moves to the downside Friday (though the latter held up well), which I think is more a result of the massive Gamma roll-off rather than reaction to the Fed.

[SqueezeMetrics SPY/DIX/GEX]()

[SPY 1y]()

[QQQ 1y]()

Takeaways: Summing It Up

The violent reaction to the Fed’s comments relative to bond spreads and the reflation trade I think is overdone (as usual). It is worrying that this trade has lost steam prior to this week, but the sudden pivot by markets to think that we won’t have any inflation does not line up with what the Fed has been indicating with it’s average inflation targeting - we’ve just gone from the markets thinking the Fed won’t be able to control or prevent runaway inflation to the Fed crushing any inflation at all (i.e. the last decade). I think we’re gonna be somewhere in the middle or the former: wage increases aren’t going to reverse and the Fed wants some inflation stickiness in the short-term - it’s a good thing!We’ll need to watch this trade for the next few weeks to see if it is truly done with or this is just a reactionary pullback.

The Gamma unwind sets us up for possible volatility, and downside risk remains. Analysts have been suggesting a pullback towards the %10 range for some time now, but markets have remained resilient overall. This could continue but the specter seems to loom larger the longer we go. Pullbacks are normally a healthy thing, and a buy-on-dip opportunity if we get one.

Overall, one or two days does not establish a trend and I think  we need to watch closely over the next week or two to see how things resume after this past week’s furor.

#Bonus Charts

In one of my previous posts I highlighted a possible breakout/breakdown in ATVI and APPL respectively and wanted to revisit these charts:

[ATVI 1y]()

[AAPL 1y]()

ATVI broke above my signal line at the $98-99 range and then immediately broke down [seemingly on news of a delay on a shareholder vote concerning the CEO’s pay package. Not a great look for the stock](https://www.ft.com/content/2049c3fc-bee9-490a-a317-f406a7419d57). 

Meanwhile, AAPL flirted with breaking below it’s 200DMA and then immediately reversed and established an upward trend. It’s hitting resistance around the $130 level, and I’d say we’d need to see this break out above the $135-136 level to be legit.

Anyway, so HR (Hindenburg Research) looks for heavily  invested-retail stocks, with heavy-bull $$$$, they enter these massive short positions and then they construct these intricate DDs called ""investigations"" on why you should short with them, then the next day, the stock will drill, HR will take profits and the stock either flops or goes back to business in a few months. The big difference maker between our DDs and their DDs is they have fucking money to distribute their idea. I think they were right about the previous companies, but they're definitely stretching with DKNG.

**Who is Nathan ""Dick Sucker"" Anderson?**

Nathan Anderson is an absolute crook.- the CEO of Hindenburg. This guy literally think's he's God's gift, check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

You can check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for your own eyes, but this guy is an absolute dick-wad and he really think's he is better than everyone on WSB/retail bros, just because he's had three successful trades, but I think he turned on the wrong stock with DKNG. So we've established that he's a dick head, but what else about him?  He's also been investigated for pump and dump cases before.

Sounds pretty similar to DKNG, doesn't it? Making up information for their own financial gain. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/a38lsw/hindenburg_research_listed_in_pump_and_dump_court/). Essentially, Anderson was releasing fake sources and articles through an alias of a company that was linked to [HR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSLimited/comments/lthtry/i_did_investigation_for_hindenburg_report_issuers/) Promoting their idea and trying to profit off false information.

[He's currently being Investigated by the SEC? - Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Next_Parfait_1885/comments/nuzu66/nate_anderson_of_hindenburg_being_investigated_by/)

Not sure how accurate this is, but supposedly, he's currently being investigated by the SEC for Misconduct. I guess their website keeps getting taken down by the SEC for investigation. To conclude, Nathan Anderson, is an absolute corporate, pump and dump, shill artist. He doesn't like WSB as you can tell from his tweets and he thinks he's God's gift to drop and article and just instantly make money, regardless of whether it's valid or not. Fuck that Dickhead. This guy, his tweets, his actions should be enough alone to fight against this guy and any company he shorts.

**THE ARTICLE**

The article is absolute trash, if you haven't seen it yet- [here it is](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/).

There's basically two key arguments. The first, DraftKings is tied to illegal revenue streams (poor sources). Second, DraftKings is overvalued (with some weak fundamentals) So I will be discussing these two arguments and talking about why they're dead ass wrong and/or just plain don't matter.

Before we go in, please watch this CNBC segment from yesterday morning. They explain it very well. TL;DR, SBtech has little to no value for DKNG.  [https://streamable.com/ng95ed](https://streamable.com/ng95ed)

**SBTECH - ""the illegal revenue stream""**

SbTech may or may not have been involved in some shady business altercation back in 2014-2017. You can be the judge of that, but I can assure you that as of the DKNG acquisition, they are most likely clean.

What is [SBTech?](https://www.sbtech.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/tz910a0xum571.png?width=1239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46213501992f1d2b9a2a4ee67a015eb6a5bc9231

Essentially, SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks. They are the data analytics. They don't own psychical sportsbooks, rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding. HR believe's that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via  a pseudo company, BTI company (kind of ironic right, the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information- is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name), all because of their locality (their offices are close - they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao??), they have similar source code (they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code, you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website) and their CEO (BTI Company) is friends with the founder of SBTech (people who are in similar business tend to work together). But the factor of the matter is, a quick google search from [Bit Core Tech](http://bitcoretech.com/), and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Lastly, they use hypothetical sources, stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech, saying everything they do is illegal, are you actually going to trust a Hedgie who's manipulated information before, I Know I'm not. Regardless, does it even matter?

https://preview.redd.it/jm9edcs4vm571.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82be3c18abbe64255db6a857f1f6e83dfaef7caa

[Source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/39376/sbtech-oregon-sports-betting-contract/)

What's kind of crazy, is that they (SBTech) have an exclusive deal with the state of Oregon, yet HR thinks that their research team is able to do a better investigation than the state of Oregon, and the Department of Justice.  Not only that, the laws associated with establishing a mobile sports gambling license are insane, to think that state and federal investigations weren't able to find any illegal activity is down right laughable.

https://preview.redd.it/ia8rgdv8vm571.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd6e9dee68b3cdbcea1d10bb4b6d2dc97c4f8044

They estimate that roughly half of SBTech's 2020 revenue came from unregulated markets, and about 10% of DKNG's B2B revenue comes from SBTech, so what does that mean? That mean's they're creating fud, this is funny, just wait. Let's say that hypothetically speaking they're right, and DKNG is committing to fraudulent revenue streams, how does this affect their current revenue?

[B2B revenue = $31,429,000 \(SBTech accounts for 10&amp;#37;\) = $3,142,900 total revenue to DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/6hm3rhjbvm571.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b96263e1539518c0aaa7d08178051e52989815b2)

[$312,376,000 TOTAL revenue so far in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/6rxoj77dvm571.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f063aa6efa69b2270d87c2ee868cabd562c5f35)

Yeah, so worst case scenario, HR is right and DKNG has to remove SbTech from their revenue, damn. Looks like they lost a whopping \~1% of their current revenue stream. Not a massive hit considering they only have access to 25% of the current U.S. Population.

[Bullet point 2 - 25&amp;#37; of U.S. Population](https://preview.redd.it/fzn2q88fvm571.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2513a920a090df8dc4f21da061fb65b5be5dbbc9)

Another big point for HR was that insiders were selling. Who the fuck cares- when has insider selling ever been a clear bearish since, news flash , it hasn't. You don't even know what they're doing with that money. They could be investing BACK into the company for all well know. Plus, this back tests back to JUNE of 2020, literally a few months after they dropped the SPAC. Who knows if any of these sales are due to SPAC merger. What's way more important is institutional purchases

**Closing Statement - Who are you going to trust, a DKNG Investor, User, and Lover, me (and Queen Cathie Woods) or Nathan Anderson the CEO of Hindenburg Research, your corporate crook on steroids, he brags about being better than you're average retail investor/wsb'r on his private twitter, he's been charged in a previous pump and dump scheme for spreading false information under a pseudo name and he may or may not be currently under the investigation by the SEC. His current allegation against DKNG is just another one of his pump and dump's off fake news. DKNG is undervalued, his false accusations of illegal revenue are irrelevant, SBTech only accounts for 1% of DKNG's** ***current*** **total revenue. In the expanding sports-gambling market, their B2B sales will be completely irrelevant as their Sportbook Sales Revenue will \~10x in the next few years as more states legalize sports gambling and DKNG is able to reach the remaining 75% of the U.S. population. Don't listen to the hedgies. Goodluck out there.**

##Where Is The Correction?

Seems like over the last week or two (or three), there’s been some media attention around a possible correction. It makes sense: we’ve had some volatility lately, seasonality is upon us, markets have looked somewhat extended at all time highs. And yet, it seems like we just can’t get a meaningful pullback. Two weeks in a row we touched the 50DMA on SPY, the Nasdaq found support about 8% down from its ATHs, and the Russell has been trading in an ever tighter range, but there’s been no urgency to the selling and just a week and half after hitting some recent lows we’re back just a few points off ATHs. 

Analyst calls for a pullback are still out there, but even they concede that they’ve no idea when and we could possibly see new ATHs before such an event occurs. After the recent weeks of scary inflation data (bonds aren’t buying it), a _digital asset_ crash, and recently Fed taper talk, you have to wonder what would be the catalyst to initiate such a pullback if we’re still just a few bps off ATHs after all that. 

Close to six weeks on, the picture looks different. We’ve reset some of the stretched technical indicators, the inflation data looks temporary (for now), and the market held up well through some choppiness. To summarize the thoughts of other, more knowledgeable people: perhaps we’ve had the pullback we’ve been looking for, just more controlled and constrained to the sectors and stocks that needed it. 

Alright, let’s move on and look at some charts…

##Charts

[Sector Performance, 1y]()

Performance has been relatively flat lately, with the exception of ARKK - it’s had %12 bounce in the last week and a half, since the most recent bottom on the 19th:

[ARKK, 1y]()

There’s also been an uptick in meme stock bullishness, and there seems to have been a broad bounce in risky / non-profitable growth stocks, perhaps correlated to the recent unwind in _digital asset_ markets?

Running down through the major indices:

[SPY 1y]()

[QQQ 1y]()

[IWM 1y]()

- SPY trading in a narrow range since mid-April; since the last bounce we’ve been drifting upward which seems to be the direction of least resistance. Will be bullish if we break above the recent ATH at ~422 (~4238 on /ES), but could be range bound for awhile.
- QQQ in a similar situation; support at ~316, but expect to need a break above 335 (~13750 on /NQ) to warrant a bullish stance. 
- IWM still range bound, but had an encouraging week - moving through the 21 and 50DMAs, but this could just be another head-fake within this range.
- Since the recent lows on 05/19, we seem to have lost all selling conviction and are simply drifting higher. You can see MACD crossovers and rising RSI on all indices, indicative of a momentum shift. 
- However, I’d be careful about being too bullish here until we’ve had a close above the top-side of the ranges here - we may not crash but we may need some kind of catalyst to push us higher from here.
- Keep an eye on the risk-on trade: is this a momentum shift or just a bounce?

Based off the action the last few weeks and how things look now, it’s hard to have any bearish conviction in the short-term. The same could be said for the bulls, and I don’t see any catalyst to spur further upside on, though there is some argument that a Fed taper announcement would result in a bullish move; we could always just melt up as well.

With positive analyst sentiment (just one example), a valuation lagging in some aspect to peers (e.g. P/CF), and some consolidating/range-bound action since late February, this could be primed for a run, but only if we see a close above 98 - above 99 would be even better. I’d be wary to take much of a position here until then.

[AAPL - Possible Breakdown Ahead]()

AAPL’s been in this sideways range since late December, and perhaps worryingly it hasn’t matched the recent bounce-back in tech and instead is wobbling in a tight range between it’s 50 and 200 DMAs. It’s current valuation metrics are far above it’s 5yr averages, though that’s perhaps attributed to their expansion into services among other things. If we close below the 200DMA

The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\*T\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.

Here are my bull points:

**Seller Segment:**

* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of
   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.
   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.
* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -&gt; more people shopping outside -&gt; more small businesses profiting -&gt; more $
* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).
* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.

**CashApp Segment:**

1. There was a very strong correlation between B\*T\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\*T\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**
2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**
3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**
4. B\*T\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**

 **Other Bullish Points:**

* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\*T\*C. B\*T\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\*T\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**
* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:

**Bearish Points:**

* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling
* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL

**Assumptions:**

* EMT
* B\*T\*C doesn't crash before earnings

wallstreetbets,8615588,SSYS - Stratasys flying under the radar,lboyfd,ranft,1612363312,44,51,"Oraight, time for some deep dive.

You all heard about that Kathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.

I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:

* EV
* Genomics
* Technological Advancements

While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.

**Introducing Stratasys SSYS**

The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a ""Next Friday"" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.

The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ever since november its been a straight ramp up](https://preview.redd.it/5ubqsnoby9f61.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94786daf76ba06ce57ddba65cc7e3912e53d56d6)

Why it will go up:

* Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)
* Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue
* Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing
* Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)
* Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy
* Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working
* Perfectly in place at the right time
* No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls
* Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.
* Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios

The risks:

* ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)
* Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)
* Some early investor dropping out
* ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.

**Where I see it flying**

I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys). This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.

I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that **will** rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.

**The rest**

I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.

For options: Watch. the. spread!

wallstreetbets,8586787,Elon Musk trying to distract retail from Silver with recent tweets - $TSLA $SLV connection,lb58zu,tuckertattoo92,1612296953,125,0,"The gist: Elon Musk is trying to distract potential silver buyers with his recent tweets.  More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

&lt;- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. &lt;-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ &lt;-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html &lt;Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DON’T go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing.

wallstreetbets,8562347,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,larhlw,ASoftEngStudent,1612256395,129,238,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict

                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

Now in 2021, Cathie has revealed a brand new ETF called ""ARK Space Exploration"", whose ticker symbol is ARKX. Here is [video](https://youtu.be/At-OnBlsMfY) summarizing the N-1A filing of ARKX - I hope it will be useful to everyone:

ARKX will go public some time after 3/29/2021.

Theme: Invest in companies that are engaged in leading, enabling, or benefitting from products/services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.

ARKX has 4 investment categories: Orbital Aerospace, Suborbital Aerospace, Enabling Technologies, and Aerospace Beneficiary.

Risk Factors:

1. Concentrate (&gt;25% of the fund’s assets) in industrial sector and information technology sector.
2. Currency risk: a strong US dollar will negatively affect the fund due to the non-US stock holding in the fund.
3. Aerospace and Defense industry is heavily depending on US government’s demand and other government’s demand around the world.
4. Newly offered fund. No performance history is available.

Upside:

1. Credibility: Cathie Wood and the success of ARK Invest ETFs (ARKK, ARKQ, …) 
2. Promising of incredible return
3. The fund’s portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated daily.

wallstreetbets,1922447,PLTR FULL DD 🚀🚀🚀[including Demo 1/26/20 (Huge Catalyst🚀) ],l1zjuk,sketchydragon22,1611239584,55,1,"This post is going to be outlining the incoming demo day for Palantir.  It is potentially going to be the single biggest event for the stock since inception.  I'm also going to shed light on how PLTR can aid in vaccine distribution (AKA a fatty contract with Uncle Sam).  Without further or due retards, here is what that demo will entail and the optics for how that will affect Palantir's price. (Hint for all the retards that can't read🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀).

What does Palantir do? Palantir is a software company that allows big corporations and governments to consolidate data into one interface and create analysis on that data.  To go more in depth, a company has incredible amounts of information and that number becomes unnavigable by an employee ass time goes on.  This is where Palantir comes in, they source data from files, emails, license plate data, weather reports, Really the possibilities for input are endless and addressed when the software is tailored to a corporation.  With that data it searches for connections and can draw incredible conclusions based on that data.  This is the chance to invest in some big brother tier tech shit at an insanely discounted rate, because BABY WE'RE going LONG🚀🚀🚀🚀.  To emphasize how widespread the applications are here are examples.

Gotham was used during hurricane Florence to compound flood and active weather data to show the most at risk locations so they could rescue those first.  (precedent for being used in disasters)🚀🚀

It is used in counter terrorism to create risk analysis for an individual.  Say that individual recently quit his job, purchased questionable materials from a hardware store and is making a trip to a country where he has no connections.  That is how easy it is for Palantir to prevent terrorism based on information that is automatically entered into he system.  There is also speculation that Palantir tech helped find Osama Bin Laden and the CEO can't comment (sounds classified) 🚀🚀🚀

Conclusion: TAKE MY MONEY PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now onto the Demo day \[1-26-21 (4:30 ET)\] AKA ""Liftoff""🚀🚀🚀

Intro: Shyam Sankar 

Foundry:Bianca Rahill, John DiFulvio 

Gotham Demo: Doug Philippone (head of development), Andy Elder, and Martin Manville

 Also discuss NEW product Titan 

Apollo Demo: Clark Minor, Ali Mondro

🚀🚀🚀

This is Palantir's annual demo. Why is that important you might ask or worthy of being a catalyst for PLTR?🚀🚀🚀🚀

2 Reasons:

1. They are releasing Titan.  It is a direct upgrade of Gotham based on 10 years of learning.  Titan is going to be more ""performant, open and proactive"".  PAUSE: Look carefully at those words, performant and proactive...  Based on that and the fact that the Chief Operating Officer called it a ""force multiplier"", I am speculating that Titan will include a stronger AI integration.  If this is true Titan will be an exponentially more efficient system that requires less user input for final analysis.  Why is this important?  Palantir gives a lot of contracts that expire but leave the user with the old version of the software even if not renewed.  If Titan is such a pivotal upgrade of less user input (AI integration) and Greater magnitude (hence ""open"")  it will be a necessary upgrade and spur a new round of contracts.  And based on Palantir's fundamentals, startup costs for new programs like Titan are higher than renewals, so this means                            
  TENDIES ALL AROUND🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.
2. Currently there is a certain element of unknown associated with Palantir and what exactly it does.  The only demo we have is from a much older platform and doesn't show all the features to the public.  I think a huge barrier to the excitement we have to this stock is that we have done our research and know what Palantir does.  As soon as this is exposed to the public it will be a game changer for the amount of attention Palantir is getting and thereafter the demand for Palantir shares.  This stock is not on most peoples radar because they do not interact with it as they do other brands.  The demo will be a blow to this aspect and increase interest from investors and demand from customers eager to upgrade to the new technology.  It is also going to give this company the traction it needs to MOON and finally retain those day gains.🚀🚀🚀

If that wasn't enough for you Retards, there's MORE! 

We are now post inauguration of President Joe Biden.  He is eager to prove that he will handle the pandemic better than Trump did (And has already signed a number of Executive Orders pertaining to Covid-19 policy).  The single best way for Biden to make this happen is quick vaccine distribution.  Here is where PLTR comes in, Alexander Carp, CEO, recently interviewed with the Washington Post describing how Palantir can be used to distribute vaccine doses to maximum efficiency and to optimize limiting the spread of Covid-19.  Earlier this year it signed a contract(25M) with the Department of Human and Health Services to analyze Covid-19 data and give a path to the most effective vaccine distribution, this program was called Tiberius.  If the Biden administration can make quick work of this vaccine distribution and make the US a model, it will bring Tiberius to the forefront.  This will open the opportunity to license it other governments and also large healthcare companies such as chain doctors offices, nursing homes etc. to distribute their share of vaccines most effectively internally.   

When this happens PLTR will Fucking Print🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

This is an incredibly understated value, we have a compelling shared interest with the brand new president.  The value that this has for the stock long is incredible.  It will put PLTR to the front of the line for contract renewals as a trusted agency that acted as a saving grace to the administration in the first of its 4 YEARS.  This on top of the fact that they have little competition to begin with means we will be looking through our telescopes to find the shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If nothing else, our beloved Cathie Woods (everything she touches basically moons) just stocked up on a JUICY 498,000 Shares for her \[ARKK\] ETF🚀🚀🚀.

Position/ 80 shares \~$25

TLDR: Next Gen software catches bad guys and can also be used by businesses.  In bed with uncle Sam and Biden will keep it that way (Tiberius).  Demo will increase demand on both sides and trigger new contracts so we can sit back and watch this baby PRINT🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1zjuk/pltr_full_dd_including_demo_12620_huge_catalyst/,1.0
wallstreetbets,1919089,Cathie Bae helped me realise how amazing the “New Tesla” sector is!,l1qjmo,ParedCalleApuestas,1611201764,72,3,"Just some info on “the next TSLA” sector and stock.

Who here loves Cathie Woods aka Cathie bae? Who here loves NVTA? I love NVTA because Cathie bae loves NVTA. 

A little insight on NVTA:

I’ve followed NvTA since $18 before Cathie bae started gobbling it up. I sold at $30 but will be getting back into it ASAP.

1. Invitae’s mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medicine to improve healthcare for billions of people.(website)

2. Genomics is set to transform our health. Cathie Bae said genomics sector is the NEXT TSLA. 

3.You will see Invitae from birth...because they do genetics testing in utero(for idiots, that means when the baby is inside mommy’s tummy) to test for defects. That’s just the start. Now...insurances are covering these tests for almost all women! Because it’s better them to catch a defect early rather than deal with the consequences later.

wallstreetbets,1889403,Cathie Wood Plans to Start Gourd ETF After Dominating With ARKK,l07cky,AngryPheldagrif,1611014584,110,1,"**PUBLISHED MON, JAN 18 2021 7:13 PM EST** 

After a stratospheric year, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is ready to take it a step further: Into gourds.

The New York-based firm is planning to launch the ARK Agricultural Exploration ETF (ticker ARKZ), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed exchange-traded fund will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in gourd harvesting, and related agricultural commodities. 

After massive inflows over the past year, the once-niche firm now oversees about $41.5 billion in ETF products, compared with less than $3.5 billion in the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ark recently became a [top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/cathie-wood-s-ark-joins-top-10-etf-giants-with-tesla-heavy-fund)\-10 ETF issuer, thanks in large part to its $21.6 billion flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that has [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) as its biggest holding. While the vast majority of ETFs passively track indexes of stocks, Ark offers five actively managed U.S. ETFs, and Wood runs all of them.

After the close of regular trading, [Deere &amp; Company](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DE:US) soared -0.14%, while gourd futures skyrocketed on additional news that r/wallstreetbets user u/TheEmperorOfJenks was to be appointed Managing Director of the new fund.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07cky/cathie_wood_plans_to_start_gourd_etf_after/,1.0

wallstreetbets,1845648,Serious Question: Why not go all in (or mostly) on Cathie Wood’s ARK ETFs?,kxnsmc,calmglass,1610687957,40,1,"$ARKK $ARKG $ARKF $ARKW $ARKQ

This year, if ARK performs only half of what it did in 2020, a $100,000 investment today would become $200,000 by end of year.

1. In 2020 they avg roughly 200% growth... which would make 100k into 300k with month over month compounding growth.
2. Their performance in 2020 demonstrates they can not only survive but thrive through a downturn. 
3. ARK openly shares their trades daily and Cathie Wood has become such a household name, that people literally pour into any company she invests in... significantly appreciating the equity.
4. 2021 looks strong with nearly $2T stimulus, COVID vaccines, new President, etc.  

Can ARK 2X or 3X your investment in 2021?

I’m able to achieve 2X and more with SPACs and key equity investments, but it’s a lot of work and seems higher risk than ARK... since they actively manage a stronger diversification.

BULL CASE 

1. Cathie recently said herself they expect min of 20% growth next few years... I interpret this as, worse case... not likely or best case... I feel she’s trying to downplay their potential so IF they have a bad year she can say she warned everyone that repeating &gt; 200% gains like in 2020 is not guaranteed.
2. ARKS fund can’t go up forever... out flow will eventually damage the funds performance.
3. A market correction is coming.  Ok, but this will hurt most all portfolios and one could argue ARK can better “actively” manage their ETFs through a downturn than most retail and many professional investors.

So... SERIOUS QUESTION... what am I missing?  Why aren’t all you retards going all in on ARK ETFs for 2021?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxnsmc/serious_question_why_not_go_all_in_or_mostly_on/,1.0

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash deposits**

SoFi is in talks to roll out [cash deposits](/r/sofi/comments/jwjw1t/sofi_vs_chime/gcrw2o1/). A cash deposit solution will drive increased adoption of SoFi Money over accounts at brick-and-mortar banks. **Cash deposits are a big deal because they are the primary pain point for online banking holdouts.**

&amp;#x200B;

**SoFi-as-a-Service partnerships**

SoFi's consumer digital banking solution is ripe for white label expansion with major brands. The 2020 launch of [Samsung Money by SoFi](https://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/samsung-money-by-sofi/) gives a glimpse of the massive potential.

&gt;Samsung Money by SoFi is the new way to grow your hard-earned cash, letting you save, spend, and earn -- all in one secure place. Now available on Samsung Pay.

Look for more SoFi-as-a-Service deals as consumer brands and dinosaur financial firms seek to catch up.

Not limited to banking services: In October, [T. Rowe Price](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-t-rowe-price-retirement-plan-services-team-offer-financial-wellness-offerings-participants/) launched co-branded financial wellness offerings with SoFi.

&amp;#x200B;

**SoFi Member Rewards aka SoFi Points**

Currently in Early Access, SoFi's Member Rewards program is expected to roll out to everyone in 2021.

&gt;The SoFi Rewards program allows eligible members to earn points through various account activities, and then redeem those points as the member sees fit across multiple SoFi products.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can redeem your SoFi Points into cash in your SoFi Money account, into Stock Bits in your SoFi Active Invest account, as an extra payment applied to your SoFi Personal Loan or SoFi Student Loan Refinance, or as a statement credit on your SoFi Credit Card--all from your phone.

Members earn SoFi Points by opening the SoFi app, using the credit card, and by use of other SoFi products. **This program will increase daily app engagement and cross-buy of products.**

Not to be confused with existing [Member Benefits](https://www.sofi.com/member-benefits/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Galileo Financial Technologies**

[SoFi acquired Galileo](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-to-acquire-galileo) for $1.2B in April 2020.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

&gt;Galileo provides the infrastructure to facilitate core customer-facing and back-end capabilities, such as account setup, account funding, direct deposit, authorizations and processing, payments functionality, and check account balance features. Additionally, Galileo provides vertical  integration benefits with SoFi Money.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since Galileo is a platform-based business model, we track the number of accounts, which is  defined as an open account as of the reporting date. **As of September 30, 2020, there were over 49 million total open accounts on the Galileo platform.** We view total accounts as an important indicator of the number of Galileo’s customers' own customers who depend on the technology platform for a variety of products and services, including virtual card products, virtual wallets, peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank  transfers, early paychecks, and real-time authorizations.

Galileo's clients include **Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolut, Dave, Klar, Greenlight, bitpay, MoneyLion, Remitly, Uala, Shipt, Tomo, TransferWise**, and many more.

**Galileo is a core infrastructure provider to the global neobank/Fintech industry. SoFi owns 100%.**

SoFi is [expanding their offers across Galileo](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x026.jpg)'s platform of 50M-and-growing accounts. Plug-and-play loans via API.

Keep up with Galileo using their [Resources](https://www.galileo-ft.com/resources/) page.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Investing platform and Chamath as an Influencer**

SoFi Invest has a ""[Social Investing](https://www.sofi.com/blog/now-available-social-investing/)"" feature where you can view the holdings, watchlist and performance of other Members (if they opt-in). From there, you can make follow on investments/watches, discuss investments, and leave emojis.

***Will Chamath join SoFi's social investing platform? Seems likely! He is the ideal Influencer investor to promote SoFi.***

The Social Investing platform gives SoFi a means of growing SoFi Invest by bringing notable investors (and their communities) to SoFi. In a hint of things to come, **CEO Noto says: ""... we're on our way to introduce portfolios for those that you're following socially on our platform.""** This might mean one-tap portfolio duplication, or a form of Member/Influencer managed portfolios.

**This platform will increase trade volume by improving discovery and** [**social proof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)**.**

Screenshots of the platform with Member names censored:

SoFi hiring favoring experience with [social networks](https://jobs.jobvite.com/careers/sofi/job/oz5cefwO) suggests that Social Investing will continue to evolve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bank charter**

SoFi received [preliminary approval](https://www.reuters.com/article/sofi-bank-charter/update-1-fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSL1N2HJ1L7) for their banking charter and is on the way to full approval. The charter will enable SoFi to [lower costs](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x035.jpg) and compete more aggressively. SoFi hiring is seeking to fill key banking positions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Targeting $1 Billion in 2021 revenue &amp; full year profitability**

SoFi's target looks well within reach. They reported \~$200MM in revenue and a return to profitability for Q3 2020.

&gt;... pulled in about $200 million in revenue in the third quarter and also generated positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other exceptions, the first time it has done so since 2017, Noto wrote in a letter to shareholders last month.

per [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sofi-q3-revenue-hit-200-million-aided-by-low-rates).

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Card**

Currently in Early Access, the [SoFi Credit Card](https://www.sofi.com/credit-card/) is expected to roll out to everyone in 2021. [Credit Card FAQs](https://support.sofi.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004370091-SoFi-Credit-Card-NEW-).

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Services Productivity Loop**

The ""FSPL"" is the core of SoFi's B2C products.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

&gt;Our strategy, what we refer to as the ""Financial Services Productivity Loop"", is centered around building trust and a lifetime relationship with our members, which we believe will help build a sustainable competitive advantage. In order to deliver on our strategy, we must develop best in class unit economics and best in class products that build trust and reliability between our members and our platform. When we do this on a member's first product, and they later consider using a second product, they are more likely to start with our platform and we have a higher chance that they will select one of our products to meet their other financial needs. **This results in delivering more revenue per member with no second member acquisition costs, resulting in higher lifetime value per member.** This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased profits to further improve member benefits and product experience.

SoFi seeks to fulfill all of a Member's financial needs in one [super app](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErKm-aVVgAIxMyd?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096). Here is a [FSPL visual](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x009.jpg).

How is it going? **SoFi reports 24% overall cross-buy of products for Q3 20. They hit 69% for Home Loans.** As SoFi's products mature and deploy, their cross-buy will continue to grow, while Member acquisition costs will decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

**SoFi International Expansion**

SoFi's international expansion was announced in Q2 2020 with the launch of [SoFi Invest in Hong Kong](https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-invest-comes-to-hong-kong/).

&gt;Obviously, we put a lot of thought into where we chose to go with our first international foothold, and Hong Kong made sense to us for several reasons. As one of the financial capitals of Asia and a global financial center, it has a strong base of both novice and sophisticated investors that would benefit from the innovation we could bring to the market.

Members in HK can trade over 15,000 US and Hong Kong stocks for free using the SoFi Hong Kong app. This is one of SoFi's FSPL ""[top of the funnel](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001951/tm211973d1_ex99x2x024.jpg)"" feeder products. Look for HK offerings to expand.

SoFi has long planned for international expansion. From targeting [mortgages in Australia (old)](https://australianfintech.com.au/us-fintech-sofi-targets-mortgage-lending-in-australia/), [expansion to Canada (old)](https://impactalpha.com/sofi-raises-500-million-to-expand-to-australia-and-canada-441b6d84f1f0/), [Asia and Europe (old)](https://www.altfi.com/article/2322_sofi_going_global_targets_asia_and_europe). SoFi is positioned for international deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

**SoFi Stadium**

SoFi Stadium will drive brand awareness and accelerate trust building. These are both key for growth in consumer finance.

Some major events are already lined up:

&gt;The state-of-the-art stadium re-imagines the fan experience and will host a variety of events year round including **Super Bowl LVI in 2022**, the **College Football Championship Game in 2023**, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the **Olympic Games in 2028**.

Located in LA, this massive stadium is packed with benefits for SoFi Members, including line skipping, 10% cash back on concessions and merch, free bag checking, and an exclusive **SoFi Member Lounge**.

SoFi was planning to IPO at the end of 2022, which we can assume was in part due to the expected Super Bowl bump. More info at [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Member Experiences**

SoFi has hosted free in-person Member Experiences for years. These include social events at Top Golf, escape rooms, bars/dining, theaters, sport events, and so on. As well as teaching events in line with SoFi's ""Get Your Money Right!"" ethos. There are big celebration events for Members who have paid off their student loans in full.

When the virus put a pause to in-person events, SoFi expanded their digital experiences. Over 20,000 Members registered for virtual SoFi events in 2020.

As virus re-openings expand, look for [SoFi Stadium](https://www.sofi.com/sofi-stadium/) opportunities and [Member Experiences](https://www.sofi.com/experiences/) to increase.

&amp;#x200B;

**Apex Clearing**

Recognize that name from your brokerage tax forms? SoFi has a \~17% stake in Apex Clearing, which provides brokerage clearing services, margin lending, compliance, transfers, and more.

From the [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921002757/tm211402-1_s4.htm):

&gt;In December 2018, we purchased a 16.7% interest in Apex, which resulted in partial integration of the transaction clearing and asset custody functions integral to SoFi Invest. The investment has also **enabled us to participate in earnings from Apex's customer base**. As of September 30, 2020, our ownership interest in Apex was 16.8%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our equity method investment in Apex primarily benefits us in two ways: First, it facilitates better planning, coordination and integration in the technology stack for SoFi Invest, which requires clearing brokerage services. **Second, we benefit from the income earned on providing clearing brokerage services to other institutions, and earn fees for margin lending and pay-for-order flow, the latter of which consists of arrangements whereby exchanges and market-makers pay for routing them certain orders.**

Apex's clients include **Ally Invest, M1, Wealthfront, Stash, Betterment**, and others.

Learn about [Apex Clearing's solutions](https://www.apexclearing.com/solutions/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Future acquisitions**

Once SoFi's public listing via spac merger is complete, look for more strategic acquisitions. SoFi will be loaded with \~$3B in cash. Plus their newly public stock as acquisition currency.

Strategic targets may include more infrastructure providers and geographically appealing startups.

SoFi's entry into HK shows the global expansion model: Buy the local regulatory approvals overnight via a small startup, re-brand, and deploy SoFi's tech stack and talent.

&amp;#x200B;

**ARK Invest?**

SoFi has been on ARK's radar for years. It is assumed that ARK will build a position, which will blanket SoFi in ARK's halo. Possible buyers would be funds ARKF (Fintech), ARKW (Next Generation Internet), and perhaps the queen, ARKK.

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible tax solution &amp; other additions**

A couple months ago SoFi [surveyed Members](/r/sofi/comments/jec6xz/sofi_might_be_considering_tax_software/) about a possible tax filing solution. Maybe it will launch for this tax filing season.

At the start of 2021, SoFi asked for input on which new features to prioritize. Such as portfolio analytics, more advanced spend tracking, and debt repayment budgeting. **SoFi continues to iterate and improve their offerings with a focus on the Member.**

You see, in June of 2008 the a barrel of [West Texas Intermediate](https://imgur.com/a/jIggkVb) (WTI) spiked up to $147 and then down to $32 in December 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Oil Crisis of 2008

Someone could do a whole write-up on that topic, but basically, oil supply and demand curves are highly inelastic. If oil supplier A is blown up in a terrorist attack or nationalized in a socialist revolution, oil supplier B can’t just drill a new well immediately. That’s basically what happened in 2008, due to the political situations in several different countries in a short time period, oil production was severely disrupted and with increasing demand, this caused the spot price to soar.

Coincidentally, BlackRock offered ICLN to the public for the first time in June of 2008, at the peak of the oil spike at $50/share. With the spot price of oil at insane levels, talk of “peak oil” in the zeitgeist, democrats talking about addressing climate change head on with a cap-and-trade bill, investors suddenly were dreaming of the post-oil future. There was a lot of interest in investing in green energy companies. Who wouldn’t want to buy shares in Chevron in 1897, right?

Well, unfortunately for the retards that gobbled up whatever BlackRock was peddling, June 2008 was a bad time to go long on any security, as Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy in September which would create a global recession and swift fall in oil prices as demand plummets during recessions. With a barrel of oil cheaper once again cheaper than a keg of bud lite, green energy stocks plummeted.

# Climate Change

In case you were eating crayons in grade school,  you see, carbon emissions are heating up the planet and it’s creating an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, severe snowstorms, tropical storms and the like. Even if you don’t give a shit the polar bears or Australia’s tourism industry or Florida, the extreme weather events are not ideal.

So let’s solve climate change then? There is a big problem though. Actually solving climate change has this unfortunate effect of reducing the viability of companies in the O&amp;G sector, which means if passed, O&amp;G workers will lose their jobs.

Doubly unfortunate for the democrats, O&amp;G workers are concentrated in a bunch of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas etc. These states have entire cities where the local economy is entirely dependent on O&amp;G companies.

Your average democratic primary voter though, does not live in one of those cities. Their general attitude can be (somewhat unfairly) boiled down to “we have to do this thing that’s morally important to me, and we have to make some sacrifices, and you will have to lose your job and I will keep mine, but we have to make sacrifices, or the world will LITERALLY end by 2040.”

# The cap-and-trade bill of 2009

There is a quite straightforward solution to climate change: cap-and-trade. The idea is that every year government will offer permits to emit X tons of CO2 and sell these to the highest bidder. These will then be tradable assets. So it’s a market based system, where the price of the permits directly reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuels when zero-carbon energy is also available.

So in 2009, Obama admin with Senate democrats came out with this plan to fix climate change, known as the [“Cap-and-Trade Bill”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act).

Cap-and-Trade was immediately unpopular among Americans, republicans and blue dog democrats seized on the opportunity to shit on Obama for his job-killing tree-hugging agenda, with hilarious ads such as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be)

As you can see in the ad, Joe Manchin eventually killed the cap-and-trade bill and West Virginia’s coal industry was revived (no it wasn’t, because coal isn’t competitive with O&amp;G anymore).

From here on out, a rift emerged amongst democrats and republicans, because the liberal democratic party primary voters DEMAND action on climate change while the electoral college and the senate punish action on climate change. So the issue these days is more polarized than abortion (actually).

# Biden’s Energy plan

Now, the environment &amp; healthcare were and continue to be the top issues for the democratic base, including its most active voices. Biden may have lost some of these voters in the primary, but he brought them into his coalition in the general and won the white house.

Basically Biden needs to throw some ~~red meat~~ vegan burger patties at the base.

Now, Green New Deal doesn’t include any mention of a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, I assume, because socialists hate market-based solutions that actually work. Instead it asks for a $100T in infrastructure spending.

With Joe Manchin still in the Senate, locked &amp; loaded ready to shoot cap-and-trade again, that’s not happening anyway.

But as it happens, this green infrastructure spending isn’t such a bad idea. Because infrastructure spending is popular across the aisle. It creates jobs, and does not directly destroy O&amp;G jobs. As we saw this year, the treasury can just sell trillions of bonds with no downside and JPOW will happily exchange them for real dollars.

And the end goal of Democrats is to try to use that money to get a bunch of people in the Sunbelt and Texas employed in green energy, as an electoral counterweight to everyone employed in O&amp;G.

# Conclusion

So Biden's plan will not include a carbon tax or cap-and-trade bill, or at least won't focus on it. Instead it will involve pumping trillions into green energy infrastructure with the goal of getting Americans across the Sunbelt &amp; Texas employed in Green Energy, as an electoral counterweight to all those employed in O&amp;G. Getting people dependent on green energy in swing states is the only path forward for democrats.

In other words, Biden will order Mama Yellen to sell trillions and trillions of Treasury bonds, which JPOW will happily exchange for real dollars, which will then be used to give fat government contracts to ICLN’s holdings and beyond.

# How to monetize this:

ICLN’s holdings are only 34% US based. Which is less than ideal because Biden's platform includes ""Buy American"" and one of their political goals is to employ as many Americans as possible in green energy, so I expect them to prioritize American companies when handing out contracts. Though of course, if Biden is pumping a million trillion into solar, I can't imagine South Korean solar panel producers don't also get some of that.

ACES (another clean energy ETF) is 80% US and 20% Canadian, and TAN (solar focused) is 50% US. ACES is lower volume though and has fewer strikes so it's up to you, I think it's getting slept on here.

Additionally, if you don't already have enough exposure to TSLA through stock, options and ARKK, QCLN is another option similar to ICLN.

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

The Columns to pay attention too:

* EXP: Expiration of the contracts
* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised
* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract
* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)

# Call Flow

*Processing img asn0bkz3de961...*

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

*Processing img ncsrdwq6de961...*

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Target Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 040n3avbde961...*

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself. 

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans? 

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker. 

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](https://preview.redd.it/tqvmp0b04te71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06f3e05363260b81cb9a83a745d708b65236332)

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&amp;#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/8ollr3bn4te71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b67e0273de08a10972ab8b504df1e24d08001d31)

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**. 

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen. 

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ousepa/the_roaring_2020s_why_the_mother_of_all_crashes/), where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**. 

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

[Not a great chart, but I want that third arm](https://preview.redd.it/ldkkwbr59te71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3289a6dfc74a66ca54b5a0190ce3a5bcf510b99)

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis and asks, ""Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..."" I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***. 

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/2r1mpc21bte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab25127dfa2315936f5ab4a26f72266bfdf0c06d)

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome. 

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](https://preview.redd.it/dgcoewescte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cade3c1428ee8da90fa816f527f849d258d69e9)

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company. 

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](https://preview.redd.it/4apb6z1udte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3694002b6d5912eaa9ec3710f3d81a707c0d3cce)

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/k0hfqxe5gte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6edb9ddba318a1bc93e07bd59390d47db906e6)

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds. 

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&amp;#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](https://preview.redd.it/hcm8mebchte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=040eddc1c05adcbf6e258154597e8fdb1b7c8712)

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](https://preview.redd.it/iedoxkj1ite71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71bbc455f0b4d93df3d14b88b4651fe4a2d6f606)

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that. 

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie &amp; the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.' 

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it. 

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](https://preview.redd.it/imq7835hlte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=426c7630ae777261d97a8f37ef08a575b67520c5)

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/qehlylrcmte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b50a35e7cb5bcf7c91c9570ac9b69291f6e876)

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun: 

[Yep, still looks bad](https://preview.redd.it/qzs8yizwmte71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90cd95571285e835337935af6a7c79857a0f984c)

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here. 

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon. 

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*. 

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play. 

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap. 

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

[Good luck Jim!](https://preview.redd.it/qsap2lax0ue71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0e0cbfd1ee6ceaba5ded01887a1229f07df2bb)

&amp;#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

&amp;#x200B;

I've no positions relative to this post, but here's the **Portfolio of Destiny**:

wallstreetbets,10677823,Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon,onbf5v,abdul10000,1626690805,140,1,"I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

wallstreetbets,10676950,Market Perspective: Recent Trends and Performance in Charts,on00fy,_foldLeft,1626644328,17,1,"Since the volatility in mid-late May I’ve been generally bullish on the market: it seemed that nothing could accelerate meaningful downside move and this I think was further proven with the post-FOMC reaction of a small stumble and then right back up.  And while I’ve continued to be bullish more recently, I have been looking at and discussing metrics and commentary around market breadth and the authenticity of this latest move to ATHs. 

Let’s look at some charts to build context:

[SPY vs RSP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/yle3no63h1c71.png?width=2468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d46c316f0f5d2f747a9b588dbb2daf068c77e5)

[SPY vs MAHP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/m3fz1fl6h1c71.png?width=2468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a9e328184bf854a5efab5e38ec73bc98ebebdfe)

[SPY vs S5FI 1y](https://preview.redd.it/6m20ma08h1c71.png?width=2468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eaedcdde07a1210d9b6e6a1954afa31adac129f)

In the first chart we compare the performance of the SPY to the RSP, the latter being the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index. We can see that while the SPY has bounced to new highs from the mid-June low, the RSP has traded largely sideways. At first this may look similar to previous patterns in the chart where the performance has diverged, but this is in fact a divergence of direction - one going up and the other sideways. This is still a nascent pattern in my opinion, but a worrying sign if this continues. 

The second chart shows the SPY vs the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks making new all-time-highs, the latter of which continues to hover in a range around %10. For example on Friday only \~%9 of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at ATHs. 

Our last chart shows the the SPY vs the S5FI, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks above their 50DMA at close on any given day. 

**What this might tell us is that this recent rally has been narrow**, in other words lacking broad participation and fueled by a few select stocks dragging the index higher. That’s generally not considered a healthy move and can be indicative of a stall-out or perhaps a setup to some downside.

So while the indices have moved higher as of late, there doesn’t seem to be a particular sector that’s been leading the way, and in fact it seems like we’ve had more downside than upside moves sector-wise through the last few weeks.

Let’s also take a look at the RSP and ARKK charts:

[RSP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/b3pzay5nh1c71.png?width=2107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=394227ea5d3e071fea09fe25f67694d336512ff0)

**Takeaways**

* ARKK, representative of the growth trade, seemed like it had taken a turn for the better but then stalled out around the 130 mark which seems to be overhead resistance. It’s since given back a good bit and with it now below it’s 200DMA I wonder if we’ll continue to see further downside here.
* I think the RSP here tells us a lot. It’s been in a tight range for awhile now and failed to make new highs in concert with the SPY which again is a real indicator that a handful of stocks are dragging the index higher.
* IWM continues to be range-bound, but I’m getting the feeling we could test the lower end of that around the 208-210 area soon given recent performance.
* SPY and QQQ don’t look terrible, especially with last week’s stumbles cooling off RSI, but as I’ve discussed here the credibility of this rally is in doubt.
* As mentioned above, it's hard to see any clear leader here in terms of a trade, but also hard to see a meaningful pullback happening either. Perhaps this earnings season will be the catalyst for some well-defined action/direction going forward.

I think at a high-level I buy in to this idea that we’re in a “phase two” of this bull market, where phase one has aggressively pulled forward valuations and now companies must prove their stock’s worth. This likely means a more challenging environment where we trade sideways at the index level and investors must find alpha at the individual stock level, and I think this has really been the case since February or March this year.

wallstreetbets,10666896,Internet explorer thoughts on why cathie trimmed pltr (and other points),ok1905,Impossible_Goal_6514,1626257149,15,1,"Cathie wood once said that karp spoke her language by focusing on long term play. But proceed to trim pltr by 710,825 shares around late June. 

Arkk holds ~22,367k(As of 14Jul) and Arkw holds ~5,311k(As of 06Jun). 

Assume arkk were trim, 
sell off = 710k ÷ ( 22,367k+710k+5,311k) = 2.5%
Assume arkw were trim,
sell off = 710k ÷ ( 22,367k+5,311k) = 2.6%

Either scenario, total sell off is less than 3%. 


Considering if cathie is determined to sell a company, she would have sold off entirely like how she sold spce. 
Now, obviously cathie knows that her firm has influence over growth stocks and if her view of pltr did change, why would she sold less than 3%? 

As of today, pltr holds on top 16 spot for both arkk and arkw. 
All these facts suggest that cathie might buy even more pltr shares now that its on ~19% discount. Chances of it happening? More than 0%, that im sure. 

Now that Jedi contract has been cancelled and opens up to multiple vendors, im confident that pltr will get a slice of that $10b dollar 10year contract. Just 10% of that deal would lower the price to earning ratio significantly by providing $100m per year. Pltr has a strong reputation for US government and it's already known that pltr will support them even if the deal are not realised. With pltr handling multiple contracts with the government, that only meant pltr must be part of the consideration (Not on the cloud service side).

So, the real question now is how would pltr expand their business since they are not short on cash(A 10-Q filing reveals $132 million in total PIPE (private investment in public equity) stakes in these businesses). Personally, I hope to see pltr become a company that is capable of utilising AI for mass expansion, thus providing individuals with customizable software for decisions making/suggestions providing. Am I high? Maybe... 

To test out my thesis, I went out and got myself a whisky (Nikka Whisky from the barrel) and drank a couple of shots. Thesis checked out alright.

And of course I know what you are about to say, just 1 type of alcohol might give me a bias point of view. So I went out again and got myself a Sake. Came to a conclusion that my DD is solid. 

While my 2022 leaps has 1 leg in the coffin and shares diagnosed with late stage limp-penis syndrome, i remain extremely bullish on pltr. Pltr 🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕

wallstreetbets,10654901,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,ohm7bl,HoleyProfit,1625935687,41,1,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago. 

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and asset the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out. 

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)  

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

GME 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ga2p6b14xea71.png?width=1712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebef27e824a720d8c5230cf8af903a78aab51a38

Then it went into the next stages of the move. 

https://preview.redd.it/nom6zafoxea71.png?width=1704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4005cf390fd6ac223164841a16f79694eed267b

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct). 

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC. 

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move. 

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast; 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I am holding 300 shares of QQQ, and other stocks (QQQJ, MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOGL etc). I am also shorting SQQQ. I am not shorting covered calls of these stocks (QQQ, QQQJ etc) because the IV is currently low. Instead, I use the mid term ETFs (VIXM, VXZ, XVZ) to hedge. These mid term ETFs are decaying assets. In order to reduce the decay, I short OTM calls of VIXM and VXZ. Alternatively, I also directly short ITM puts. The reason is that VIX mid term ETFs have much higher IV than QQQ or SPY. If QQQ goes higher, the gain of my QQQ is substantially greater than the loss of my mid term VIX ETFs. If the market goes sideways, I can still make money because I short VIXM/VXZ options.

I am shorting UNG (natural gas) call spreads and long term holding UNL to hedge UNG. I lost a lot of money recently due to natural gas rallying. But I will continue to short UNG, because in long term it is in downtrend due to contango most of the time, although currently it is not. This position is 7% of my portfolio.

I am longing SLV and PSLV (silver) and shorting very long dated covered call (500 days), because I have a large position which is 40% of my portfolio, also because silver is more volatile than QQQ, and I don't want my portfolio to fluctuate too much.

I am holding BLOK (blockchain) and ARKK , and shorting covered calls because of the relatively high IVs (40%) compared with QQQ. The current IVs are not as high as that early this year. But I think it is ok but not ideal to sell covered calls if the IV is more than 40%.

I am also holding KWEB (China Internet ETF). But I am not shorting covered calls as I did early this year, due to the low IV. This position diversifies my portfolio. The reason I don't choose ASHR (China 300 ETF) is that I think technology has more upside potential.

I bought USO (crude oil) when it was very low. I used to short ATM calls. Now I am shorting ITM calls. Other underlyings, such as US stock index, China stock index, precious metals, are bullish in the long term. Crude oil futures has contango most of the time, thus the price is not in long term uptrend. That's why I short ATM and ITM covered calls of USO. This position is 2% of my portfolio.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on Ironnet and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BiG Fucking Value, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

## What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

* Ever single trade was done on my iPhone 7 Plus with the TD Ameritrade app. Usually on my Toto toilet. I use Webull desktop client and TradingView website for watching charts and technical analysis during the day on a second monitor separate from my work setup

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d to the SOFI ticker, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too.

# Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

# Flashback - Christmas 2020

Let’s set the stage. Remember December 2020 ya’ll?

I sold 88,233 shares GME at $15.50 for some random dog toy in a box company. There were no apes yet, just Ryan Cohen buying more shares with hopes of a company turnaround. There were record COVID cases, vaccines were just approved, and there was even a British virus mutation on the way that turned out to be Delta!

# Arc of Blue Balls - Teasing little jack ($1.75M to $1.6M in 6 months)

## Chapter 1: The Squeeze

History was made in January 2021. Ryan Cohen joins the board on Jan 11. GME shoots +12% to $20 and then another +57% to $31. The media picks up the story and Elon Musk tweets “Gamestonk” and to the moon we go! Another +51% to $65. Then +92% to $150. And a deep fucking +135% to $347 before Vlad and the Hood ruined all the fun.

But we did it. History was made. The thesis was right. GME OGs are celebrating and drinking regal whiskey. Shorts got fucked and apes got born. WSB gains millions of normies. Financial world is never the same again.

And where am I? All-in CRSR with $1.7M and 1 share of GME I held on at a $20.81 cost basis. 

Lots of people have asked me about how I felt during this period, dealing with the FOMO or thinking about what could’ve been.

But the reality was: I was celebrating and dancing right alongside every single one of you GME winners. The thesis was right! This was an undervalued retail company that was way over-shorted.

Yes, I paper-handed in December and lost out on quick millions but that didn’t deter me to keep going. As a principle I don’t ever chase stocks so I let GME rocket however high it wanted to go and I just kept my eye on potential new plays. There’s always another play.

CRSR was bobbing up and down in a beautiful channel for most of Q1 until it wasn’t which made my Jan/Feb rather un-eventful merely breaking even.

## Chapter 2: RKT Up and Down

Huge short interest and a special dividend announcement in the 2/25 ER call seemed to awaken huge volume so I jumped on for the ride on 3/1 and it exploded 72% the next day gaining $1.2M overnight and bringing me to $2.9M! Almost a triple millionaire just like that.

Thinking these high volume squeeze plays usually go on for longer than a day, I held and it fell 33% immediately the next day losing me $1M. Let me tell you, **gaining a million and then losing it the very next day changes a man.**

As it rode the support line, I kept holding until the next 5/6 ER hoping that millennials are still in house-buying fever but that call gave conclusive evidence otherwise so I sold right after it dropped below support for a -19% loss.

## Chapter 3: Steel Gang

Next I decided to go all-in on CLF for the first time, an American steel company, thanks to one of the most well-researched theses I’ve ever read.

As you can see from my trading history above, CLF becomes my go-to safe haven for 2021 with 6 separate swings each netting decent % gains adding up to an amazing total $ gain.

But I’m a bit of a stock whore though as you’ll see, I love jumping around between different stocks trying to time the upswing. But CLF is like that dependable onii-chan you can return to after a good thrashing out in the harsh world and you need a good serving of humble pie.

# Arc of Erection - It’s squeezin’ season ($1.6M to $4.25M in 3 months)

Now it’s 6 months into the year and I was doing worse than the indexes! Little jack needed some more serious pumping. AMC had just christened a whole new cohort of apes, GME crossed $300 for the 3rd time, and it looked like squeezin’ season was upon us yet again.

## Chapter 4: Squeeze Trades

* **CLOV** \- 37% short interest and meme stocks were back in season so I left the safe embrace of steel to flirt with some squeezies. I finally stuck the multi-millionaire status going from $1.6M to $2.2M. Yes I sold a bit early and missed a giant squeeze on 6/8-6/9 which could’ve launched me to $5M+ but no point in having regrets, only learn from the mistakes
* **SOFI** \- Given this just deSPAC’d from IPOE to SOFI, there was a tingle that said this ChamathSPAC might do something crazy too. I woke up and saw a 148% short interest while on the toilet and in a blur went all-in cause that was too good to be true. Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

## Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

## Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

## Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

# Fin - Post-coitus retirement

# What's Next?

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

Turns out it was and my app had a data error (likely due to the ticker change) and I should’ve checked other sources and finished jacking off for that post-nut clarity before going all-in. Due to the 2-day good faith restriction in my 401k, had to wait 2 days until I could sell for a -8% loss
* **MVST** \- Adam Jonas gave this stock a $6 PT while at $8, the same guy who gave TSLA a $10 PT when it was at $200 pre-split. Because of lolz, I decided to inverse him and got my biggest % gain of 70% in only 5 trading days skyrocketing past $3M to $4.25M. And while I sold RKT too late and CLOV too early, this one I sold juuust right. That’s called learning folks

# Arc of Ascension - Rise to legend ($4.25M to $8M in 3 months)

[*Kenja-taimu*](https://www.jlect.com/entry/2891/kenjataimu-kenjataimu/) *(賢者タイム) - The post-orgasmic period when a man's thoughts are no longer impaired by his sexual drive; he is thus likened to a ""sage"" of clear mind. Literally ""sage time"".*

**Chapter 5: Luck or Skills?**

* **PLTR** \- Jumped in right before 8/12 ER with a 0/5 ER track record on a hunch it’s been so disappointing in all aspects since Jan that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. Got my first W thanks to strong commercial contracts growth and +13% in the bag.
* **SKLZ** \- Another big disappointment since Feb but seems to have bottomed out. Also because of Big. Buck. Hunter and the best [thesis](https://reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/pgpm33/do_i_have_to_post_every_day_yes_im_still_in_sklz/hbcxi1t/) I’ve ever written. Nothing majorly notable besides the thesis.
* **AMZN** \- Flight to safety after losing $400K thinking AMZN hadn’t moved much in 2021 but being a boomer was not much fun.
* **TMC** \- Major FOMO from missing out on IRNT and OPAD’s deSPAC stock redemption gamma squeezes made me emotional. Mining special metals from the bottom of the ocean, sure why not? Well turns out it’s pretty [sketchy](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tmc-is-drowning-in-legal-woes-and-environmental-concerns-2021-10-25) so I’m glad I only threw $1M at it but still ate a -25% loss.

**Chapter 6: Plot Armor Fully Activated**

* **CLF** \- It was so great to be back with steel gang after so many ins and outs just in time for 10/22 ER. I’ve never lost money with CLF and this time was no different. It was all up to LG to deliver and boy did he deliver with upgraded guidances and my 2nd ER win in a row. Getting on Twitch to hear the call live with steel gang is still one of my favorite memories. The [transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/) is full of great quotes of LG demolishing analysts – “That's math lesson, not chemistry!” Officially a penta-millionaire with $5.7M.
* **TDOC** \- Time to go for the ER turkey with 3 Ws in a row. Went all-in on another decimated Aunt Cathy stock like PLTR with the hope that any positivity in the ER should give it a nice bump. On 10/27 after hours however, the stock drops -7% and little jack goes limp losing $400k. But the report looked… good? In a literal example of main character plot armor, the stock reverses in the morning and ends up +7% instead and little jack nuts to being a hexa-millionaire with $6.1M.

**Chapter 7: Big Fucking Climax**

Thanks to /u/_beto619 for [pointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/qhvelq/nabbed_the_6_with_new_ath_of_61m_im_a/hiym91u/) me in the direction of BGFV, an undervalued sports retailer with a high short interest and earnings coming up. This play really had it all.

* Tossed in a million for the 11/2 ER thinking this could be like a CHGG or a CAR, literal coin flip. Turns out it was both, dropping 9% after hours but recovering by morning, just like TDOC, again with my plot armor at full power
* I decided to double down in the morning with another million and then tripled down and then said fuck it and went all in
* Found out the GME OGs including /u/Uberkikz11, /u/Jeffamazon, /u/FatAspirations, /u/CPTHubbard were all on top of this play as well and it felt like a reunion
* Created a Twitter account just to react live to BGFV on a Twitter Spaces with Rod Alzmann aka Uberkikz11. Someone managed to record the last 25 minutes of it [here](https://youtu.be/ZsgJ1629eio)
* Crossed $7M, then $8M, and even $9M and touched $10m for a literal 2 minutes and all I got was this [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/eo8acvyoxtz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b6f9cf64871010dc3354879e891f77da79ee9c)
* Decided in a moment of post-nut [epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/user/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/comments/quradf/fin_35k_to_8m_228x_in_21_months_officially/hkrtri3/), that I’ve achieved my original goal of escaping from wage slavery and $8M is enough and I’m officially retiring

I'm sure I’ll hit the elusive 8 digits again some time in life, it’s only 25% away

I look forward to seeing her again

**What's Next?**

* Just got back from a lovely 18-day trip in Europe enjoying the delicious delicacies of being FATFIRE such as paying 30 euros for tiramisu to be brought up by room service at midnight and currently relaxing with family on a beautiful snowy mountain.
* My plan is to DCA into SPY/QQQ over the next few months as I have no idea which way the market will go. While it feels like I did time the top on many individual stocks by retiring on 11/15, SPY/QQQ is right back to where it was on 11/15. I’m still worried about the effects of tapering, interest rate increases, and potential lowered guidances in next round of ERs but the market also seems to be just as strong as ever so DCA seems like the best strategy here.
   * Why am I being so conservative all of a sudden? Honestly I’m just tired from trying to perfectly time everything. It’s stressful keeping up with all the news and you feel bad if you mis-timed it. I want to focus my time and energy on other things so DCA allows me to re-enter the market with less stress
* In the new year I plan to quit my job and focus on 3 things: my health, my house, and a special project. I want to live a long healthy life to enjoy this newfound generational wealth, buy all the fancy toys and do all the fancy renovations to live in a beautiful home, and build a product based on everything I’ve learned these past 2 years about personal finance and community for you guys. And no it’s not a paid newsletter or chat group or anything stupid like that. Stay tuned!

## Final Message for My Little Jacks

I really believe I just got very lucky.

* The initial $35K in my 401k was an accident. I actually wanted to take my annual Jan bonus in cash to buy some toys but missed the cutoff date to change it in Dec so it defaulted to throwing my annual bonus in my 401k
* Started trading in Feb 2020 as COVID created the most bi-polar volatile market ever swinging between covid and recovery stocks quickly growing $35k to $900k in 4 months, something that is irreproducible
* Continued trading as meme stocks and short squeezes shook the financial world before they re-tuned their algorithms and shortened their potency
* Literally got lucky on 4 coin-flip-type ERs in a row

Live to fight another day. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell. Don’t chase. Use independent thinking. It’s just money. 

All these sayings… all these lessons… at the end of this journey I’m still not sure what to make of it all. Life is short. Enjoy it as best you can. Try to do good. And try to be lucky.

I’ll still be around, probably not posting much but maybe some comments here and there.

It’s been an absolute **life changing** time with you all.

In a Friday evening blog post, Wood said that despite a brutal stretch that has compelled the operators of the ARK Invest ETFs, including the flagship Ark Innovation ARKK fund, to do some soul-searching, the fund manager is sticking to her game plan.

Last few days have been a bloodbath. However, each day was a defensive rotation except today. Today we saw large caps fell while small caps and growth stocks rose sharply, which in no way is considered a defensive play. Look at ARKK, it rose 5% today. Here’s my thought on 2 possible reasons ranked by likelihood 

1. Some hedge fund(s) went under, or was margins called. Essentially it liquidated both long (good asset, large caps) and short positions. This phenomena is similar to what we saw during GME saga. Depending on how isolated this incident was, it could be either a small bump to SPY500 or the start of the next crash.

2. Cathie Wood is going to mary Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk so there’s an influx of investment in ARK ETFs. I made this up but I couldn’t find a second possible explanation why growth stocks are back on the menu and why hedge funds wanted to cover their short positions today 

I think in the next few days, there would be an increase in market volatility. Buying a straddle should be a good way to take advantage of it. We also want to monitor the movements in overnight future market closely. March 2020 also started with hedge fund liquidity problems (not COVID related) and the overnight markets went to the crapper even before everyone was awake.

**TLDR** – Jim Chanos is shorting DKNG, he’s a well-known shorter so other firms are probably piggybacking his trades and are short DKNG as well, same set up as Melvin capital and all the firms that hopped on their GME short, big mistake for DKNG shorts, the best quarter is about to come up, plus new states opened up for even more revenue that was not included in the forward guidance. In addition Jim Chanos went on CNBC and completely shit the bed with his bear math, and got all the fundamentals wrong about this stock.

DKNG is also well capitalized to continue to grow, even in a low interest rate environment, which makes this stock unlike the other growth stocks being sold off, because spending is within control and strategic, not at risk to have to raise capital to dilute shareholders. The company is moving toward Web 3.0 and is becoming more of a tech company then just a regular gambling company.

How does the price explode, short covering + short covering on dark pools, options gamma squeeze after breakout, Algos forced to de-basket DKNG from short high growth stock basket related to ARKK and macro event driven Algos (interest rates, j-pow tapering and money printer slowing down)

**Price Point = $90+ in honour of Jim Chanos and claim that DKNG trades 30x revenue**.

**Reason #1 - Jim Chanos**

Now he’s shorting DKNG but using bogus math to do it and hoping Apes don’t know basic arithmetic.

He’s quoted in this interview [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash) with the following reasons to short DKNG:

“DraftKings has a valuation right now of 30 times runway revenue,” he told CNBC. “You can believe in sports betting ... but this business model is flawed.”

Response from the CEO :

https://preview.redd.it/1n2pxbf805481.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae8a1422235ff93384d909ebe8d960501206bee

**Jason’s right, market cap was never 30x revenue, revenue consensus for 2021 is 1.2 billion, Jim Is suggesting the market cap is $36 Billion, DKNG has not come close to that in the past few months and the current market cap $12.72 Billion.**

“If you quadrupled DraftKings’ revenue and gross profit ... and take their marketing spending, which is currently over 100% of revenue, to 10% of revenue, which is their target, and you keep overhead at today’s level ... DraftKings would still be losing $200 million a quarter,” Chanos said.

Below is from the income statement, 4x revenue gives you 851,276, he said take the marketing spending and make it 10% of revenue, so that’s 85,127.6. Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he’s gone senile.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqtolml905481.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af724b9f388a8d3796b5af8264eeeba33c0156a3

Changing a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.

Only reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.

**Reason #2 – upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**

Shorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.

During the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.

Upsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season

**Huge growth**

Growth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.

physical casino’s are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.

**Inside buying – always a good sign**

We have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft’s CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company’s future.

**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**

We get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that’s a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.

But as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.

So, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&amp;D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it’s not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.

&amp;#x200B;

The below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG. They have a large cash balance, little to no change in cash over quarters and have already stated an equity offering would only come after the stock passes $125.

DKNG can be the next Amazon or TSLA, in this case the physical casinos are physical retail and legacy auto. The growth story is the same, operate at a loss, continue to growth, kill the competition, and disrupt the market.

**Trend change - Not just a Covid Play**

More and more people are betting online, and this is disruptive to physical casinos. Even with the emergence of physical casinos into the online space like BetMGM and Penn with barstool, the motivation to pursue this area is not strong with physical casinos, due to cannibalizing themselves.

We see in this article [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks) , a huge trend change, over 64% of bets came from online, and this is in Nevada, a destination for physical casinos, imagine the rest of the country. And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.

**Espn deal + twitter**

ESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions. Same with twitter as the access to users opens opportunities to market and convert new users.

**Differentiation from current gambling stocks**

DraftKing’s has a strong focus on innovation as you can see by their patent filings, they focus on customer retention, which is a huge competitive advantage in this space, when customers can be swayed from one app to another with free promos. [https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents](https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents)

They are becoming more vertically integrated, will own their own data in the future and have incorporated the tech stake from SBtech.

The entire exec team is focused on Web 3.0 and hired or is hiring for this next phase in gambling. Internally they continue to innovate beyond new games, and this is unique to DKNG, you can go on the job sites for MGM or Caesars and you won’t find any jobs for an engineering team, this is not an area they have any interest in, this is literally Sears vs Amazon at this point, physical casinos will always have Vegas as destination spot but not much else in a few years.

**Reason #3 - Heavy short sales in Dark Pools - Over 40% + Algo basket trading manipulation**

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng)

For those interested, shorts are piling on through dark pools. Potential exist to squeeze. The use of dark pools is very interesting as we know this is to hide the obvious intention to tank the stock but the level it’s reaching is becoming absurd.

Showing similar level of manipulation that exists in AMC and CLOV, known hedge fund manipulated stocks. DKNG showing sharp declines in price despite upcoming catalyst of state legalizations and during crucial sports betting half of the calendar year.

**DKNG is showing the same level of dark pool shorting as NKLA a known fraud stock**. This make no sense other than manipulation to pin down the price for market makers to make money on options expiring worthless.

We see seemingly unrelated stocks moving down with each other for no reason. Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn’t have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.

**Gamma Squeeze Potential**

DKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.

Option chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks

While indexes have corrected really slightly, many of us saw their favorite stocks trading below their 52-weeks average or even hitting pre-pandemic levels. And of course, most of them were from the growth-segment, which is being heavily attacked by hedge-funds because of the rate-curve growth. Meanwhile investbanks are feeding people with fairy tales about safe-space in the real sector of economy, which seems like the worst place to invest in the current conditions of PPI and CPI divergence, new covid-waves and heavy debt, which doesn't have any signs of future reductions. Just look at the BA, DAL, LMT and other crap fundamentals on https://www.gurufocus.com/new_index/. Look at the damn AAPL stock which struggle with sales of their new phones and who buys congressmen (just like FB apparently - can't explain otherwise why everybody completely ignored their creepy policies) in order to monopolize digital ID with the help of taxpayer’s money (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html). And while a few stocks keep indexes high, our future icons like CRM, who now fundamentally look cheaper than MSFT and ADBE, hit 200-days average. We cannot ignore the rate fact, but it is not a reason to sell fast-growing companies, who apparently have low debts or profitable business and are classified as covid-hedge! ARKK fund has smth about 20% of short interest, and while I don't agree with many Cathies picks, I really enjoyed latest reports of companies like GPN, FISV, PLTR, MQ and some other names, in which I have small long positions and not planning to sell them in any case. And I'm sure that you too were shocked by the amount of short-sells of stocks on their earning releases, even if companies beat estimates and rose their future outlook. So, I encourage you all to once again come together and show damn hedge-funds that WE ARE THE FORCE TO BE RECKOND WITH!

Elon musk then tweets a “cyber whistle”. Since QE started in 2008 we have never had an inflation problem, so starting QE was never a concern for inflation to get out of control. 

Now we are beginning to tighten to combat inflation. If the market crashes from this news, the Fed may be reluctant to start QE since inflation is now a concern, and the reason they are tightening at a faster pace is. 

Jerome Powell just recommended a book that was written by the Fed chair during the high inflation of 1980’s, when the Fed raised rates to combat inflation, this caused assets to crash. 

J.Powell recommending this book clearly illustrates his agreement to combat inflation at any cost, which he did comment on how this Fed chairmen ignored all criticism and focused on what would be good for the people. 

J.Powell likely knows the impact of the end of QE, and is preparing himself for this unavoidable crisis. Margin is at an all time high that could accelerate any downturn in the market causing margin calls. Also; information is transmitted so quickly now that crashes occur at a rapid speed, in combination of all these things, we may see a liquidity crisis.

wallstreetbets,11249858,Imminent Stock Market Crash,r5e8oe,Round_Use1988,1638245006,555,1,"My thesis has several layers which provides a margin of safety ;  

1) Fed policy: Currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper. If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%). The same can be said when they Fed announces they are increasing QE, the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run. This has proven to be 100% accurate in the US. The market is forward looking and sees this coming, IMO the market has already topped. Of course the Fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue QE for longer, if this occurs I will cover my short. 

 2) Stocks under pressure: ARKK ETF and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down 50-70%, these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run, and the stock market participants are looking for a safe, cash flowing companies to ride into the end, that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate.  

 3) Fed announced Taper: On November 3rd the fed announced the taper, since then we've seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed. Most recent example is the new C19 variant, any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off, participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason, where in fact the real reason is because of the TAPER. We will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news.  

4) Valuation: The FAANG stocks is holding up this market, as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world. This has pushed there valuations to ALL time highs. MSFT is trading at a 37 PE and 14 PS, not seen since the Dot Com bubble. Normal MSFT or AAPL trade at a PE of 12-18 and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them.   

5) Shift to small cap from large cap?: I have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap, allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour, keep the market propped up,  however EVERY SINGLE time MSFT has corrected or crashed the market does the same. So unless this is the first time we ever see this happen, It just isn't probable.  

6) Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.  

7) Economic outlook: Inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they don't have pricing power. On top of this I expect we see a much weaker consumer in 2022/2023. The cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of people's lives, leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials. Any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new Macbook etc..  

8) China: The Chinese economy is on the brink of collapse, the real estate giants such as Evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest. Evergrande has 300 billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations. Real estate sales are down 30% in October! The Chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail, which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world. China is the #1 purchaser of commodities from countries around the world, as their economy slows they will purchase less ,which will put pressure on other countries GDP,  we have already seen a massive slow down in China doing just this!  

9) Market is currently crashing: The Russel 2000 peaked a couple weeks ago on November 8th and is already down 10%. In nearly ever case small cap lead a crash (not including black swan events) and the S&amp;P follow behind within a matter of weeks. Also; technical analysis on the FAANG stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked, which would be very consistent with the Russell leading the crash and 2 weeks later (now) the FAANG beginning their crash.   Thank you for reading. Please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk.  Don't fight the FED, adapt to their policy.

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

&gt;**BULL** You believe in the emperor Jamie Powell and the fair lady Yellen. May CPI was just transitory inflation from a burst of demand. You have eyes and see that commodity futures are correcting. You are emboldened by the recovery of coins and growth stocks in the past weeks. You love buying high.

[Basic]: Buy anything but the banks and industrials.

[Risky]: $ARKK, $SQ calls

[YOLO]: June &amp; July calls on literally any growth stock

[You hate money]: 1DTE QQQ call on June 9

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&amp;nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y]()

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD]()

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y]()

[QQQ 1y]()

[IWM 1y]()

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y]()

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** Median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&amp;nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them.

Due to getting a salary increase I finally have some extra money to yolo into the market.  Instead of yoloing into FDs like you mouth breathers I'm going to be yoloing into leaps. One per month, for the year. 

My plan is to sell after 3 months if it hits 100% profit. And then roll them into new leaps. 

Anyway thinking about going into ARKK for my first pick .

I have followed Ms. Wood since she appeared on We Study Billionaires. From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&amp;#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000. 

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngdlvk/inverse_cathie_wood/,1.0

wallstreetbets,10128287,"Market Review: A look at recent trends, performance, and some assumptions on where we go from here",neeinl,_foldLeft,1621253364,0,1,"Recently I've been trying to put my thoughts and analysis down in writing, instead of just living in my head, as a way to fully think through what's rolling around in my head as I look at charts, read articles, listen to podcasts, etc. Every so often I start to see an opportunity to re-assemble my view of the market and make some assertions, and I think after last week this is one of those times.  
&amp;nbsp;

So I want to start by giving some disclosure on my recent positioning and what _I'm_ trying to get out of this. In mid-late April, I switched into short positions on all indices and got long a VIX, all through longer-dated options. We were chopping around ATHs, things looked stretched, stocks were selling off on huge earnings beats and seasonality was something to consider.   
So I took the viewpoint then that we'd see some downside volatility sometime in May, and I was anticipating a 5-10% pullback when all was said and done. Well, three weeks later we've had a move to the downside, but things kind of look different now and while I unwound some of my shorts last week I'm trying to determine if this sell off is done or if we're due for a larger downside move. 

###Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/LJ0t7jN)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/lEBNPW2)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

###Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/6mXqqVF)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/NVWss5e)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/SylCIJy)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.  
Take-Aways:  

- QQQ, IWM have been in this kind of “chop zone” since about mid-Feb, and technicals look somewhat bearish here.
- SPY has maintained performance, and along with the DOW (not pictured) has led the market higher
- Looking at the charts, every pullback has been bought and we can’t seem to get any meaningful breakdown. Buy the dip has to continue to be the mantra.  

Comparing these to our sector charts, we can see we need to look at more than one thing to tell a story. These indices, due in part to how they are constructed, do not highlight the rotation and churn that’s been going on - the rotation out of high growth stocks into value with the latter responsible for driving the market higher as of late.  

To further illustrate that last point, let’s look at just one section of the market as an example:

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected Indices 1y](https://imgur.com/LJmHP8r)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

##The Recent Pullback and What to do Next

So I think a good place to start with respect to _what next?_ is to rehash this last week. Starting off with a downside move, this accelerated Wednesday as the market “reacted” to the CPI data. I use quotes here because I don’t fully buy the inflation narrative that the media is spinning and I think for the most part neither does the market. Inflation is a whole separate post, that I may do at some point.  
Anyway, we followed this sharp downside move with a sharp upside move and by the end of the week the damage wasn’t all that bad. However, this snap-back may be concerning in terms of legitimacy and at least as far as QQQ and IWM go we’re still looking bearish. 

To get an idea if the selling here might be done or not, I thought it worth a look at some of QQQ's largest components individually:

[AAPL 1y](https://imgur.com/Z0Bh0mD)

[INTC 1y](https://imgur.com/VOwvNhH)

[NVDA 1y](https://imgur.com/OmqYSET)

[FB 1y](https://imgur.com/4JgNVxl)

Along with some others not shown here, these show a common pattern: all sitting at some kind of support level.  
If we see a breakdown below these levels... watch out. But I have a feeling we're largely done here. 

###Building a Thesis

I'm just gonna throw down some bullet points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading: 

- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Tech / growth seems to be at support, and may indicate the recent selling here is done, but that doesn't mean we're going to be seeing ATHs again here anytime soon.
- Need to watch out for Fed tapering talk. There is talk that the Fed will need to at least taper it’s QE programs at some point and some expectation that could start to be communicated as early as June. Market reaction here will be interesting.
- Inflation reactions. Along with the bond market and Fed, I may believe that surprising inflation data will be temporary and normalize but we could see short-term volatility around these events while the greater market digests it.
- The leading sectors, banks and industrials, were looking pretty stretched at the beginning of this week. Ending largely unchanged, the volatility has helped reset some of those overbought indicators though they are still high. I think weakness here could lead to a greater sell-off and performance of these is something to closely watch.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- **Buy The Fucking Dip**. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all the bullshit, but there is no way in hell you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&amp;nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/neeinl/market_review_a_look_at_recent_trends_performance/,1.0

Hopefully this doesn't end up too disjointed - I'm trying to put this together in the midst of a hangover either from last night, my second covid shot yesterday, or some combination of both, and I'm finding it a bit difficult to be any kind of articulate.

But it's not just tech companies that had their public offerings in 2020-2021. 2019 public offerings Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which, except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from 63.40 on Apr 28 to 46.02 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 77.58 to 55.45 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70.45 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend either preceding earnings for the companies that reported this week and following earnings for those that reported in the previous weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbxdcs/a_reckoning_for_tech_202021_ipos_coinbase/,1.0

wallstreetbets,10069353,Why I’m shorting $ARKK,n8zu9z,Accomplished-King-45,1620636833,0,1,"I hate being on this side. I hate it when I’m long on a certain company that I love and it triggers a sell signal. But guess what, this market doesn’t give a fuck to your emotions. I’ve been in this market for almost 10 years and I think I have the capability in explaining my current position against ARKK. I know when to take huge risks and when to calm down. For anyone saying that I’m pumping my position, 15k members aren’t capable of doing such things. Before reading my reasoning, I’d like you to get to my account see my previous posts and figure the prices, the hints, and the dates of these previous positions. 


1. History of “Momentum Funds” 

Several funds and ETFs were glorious before the DotCom bubble, until the crash, they became known as the funds that followed momentum and 3-year’s performance was the only thing they had. Do your own research. I believe Cathie Woods would be the face of the downfall of “Disruptive Companies”. There’s no such thing called speculation in this field, fundamentalists always win and nothing has beaten them since the begging of the equity market in Holland. People including Cramer believed that we’re entering a new era with huge conceptual changes in markets. Guess what, Dotcom bubble occurred and he became a reporter after being a fund manger gaining at least “$10 million dollars a year”.

2. ARKK has reported the highest outflow for 6 consecutive days. Amounting to 1.4 Billion dollars of outflow which is equivalent to almost ~7% of NAV. It’s the first time happening since the launch of the fund. This would affect all ARKK’s holding since the fund is obligated to liquidate this portion to cover its obligations. This means Cathie Woods won’t be able to pump certain holding unless she changes weighted distribution of positions. This is serious, since it has and will affect TSLA, ROKU, ZM and other holdings. 

3. In terms of price movement and technical analysis. ARKK has been playing under the 50 day MA for a few days. It has recorded the lowest weekly close since 25 November 2020. It has also indicated a blow off after setting $159 as an ATH. MACD bearish cross hasn’t reached it’s peak yet. 

4. The large inflows in the healthcare and housing industry in the past month also indicates a continuation of investors’ unattractiveness for growth stock speculating for a rise inflation. Pipeline sabotage from Russian cyber attackers has limited the time before we see the rise in inflation. As commodities have rallied in the past 20 days.

5. The 10-YR Tbill yield has retested 1.5% and is now aiming for the skies. I would like you to open the TNX on weekly frames and observe the year 2012 when it first hit 1.5% ever. Check for 2016 and it’s rally after touching it, also the same for 2019. Then open the daily frame and observe the nastiness of the last candle after touching 1.48 and quickly closing near the top at 1.59. A 0.11 change is something we rarely see and is below the yearly volatility average.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8zu9z/why_im_shorting_arkk/,1.0
wallstreetbets,10057730,Palantir (PLTR) Valuation Comparison with its High Growth SaaS Peers,n877f3,AlteregoMike,1620537173,98,1,"I am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your ""seeing stone"" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:  
\- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **neither cheap nor overpriced** among peers.

\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.

\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.

\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \~600. I heard that HFs still **wait for earning to confirm** the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk

\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning after hour. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**

\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR &amp; 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat &amp; raise. There is certainly short term hype &amp; risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**

PS:  
Please follow me on Twitter [https://twitter.com/MikeyJia](https://twitter.com/MikeyJia) if you find such analysis useful. I am just starting but will continue to publish interesting data point about companies like PLTR.

wallstreetbets,10039392,#ArchegosDIY - Trading with 25x leverage through Q1 and the May market pullback: Pros and Cons,n6x9b0,diggonomics,1620390230,34,1,"**Disclaimer:** Using options and trading with high leverage implies massive risk. This material is for educational purposes only.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV &gt; zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

Today is the anniversary of the Flash Crash of 2010.  It has everything to do with the market manipulation that we're seeing today, especially in small cap tech.  The actual time of the flash was 2:32, about 3 hours from now.  Look it up.  It's retail trading history, and it was a wealth grab in the trillions. 

Today is the turning point for many of Cathy's portfolios, and if ARKK loses support at 105.50, the entire sector is going to plummet.   ARKK will probably knife to 90.  The hedge funds will have one of their most profitable days in history.  

The Hedges want nothing more than for an embarrassed Cathy Woods to go on MSNBC tomorrow, fresh off one of the worst days of her professional life.  Regardless, she'll handle herself with dignity and grace, and in a way that no male CEO would have to do.  She's the face of more than just an ETF, and everyone knows it. 

Figure out if you love her or hate her another day- just go buy some ARK, and hold it.

In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4. The CEO (Andrew Paradise) has stated as recently as yesterday that his company aims to “gamify” exercise, education, etc. He brought up what a Peloton partnership would look like in a Fool interview yesterday. Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year. 

Apes, this is a play that has been HIGHLY shorted (28% currently) from its top, and has the actual thematic story, fundamentals, and price targets to support a huge short term run, and long term growth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwt602/sklz_on_april_23rd/,1.0

Anyway, let's take a look at this POS. 

[Shitty Chinese Stocks\/ETF](https://preview.redd.it/11eb2mkp19j71.png?width=2255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2a7f82d4809f88090e789262ce2ab35a4872f2)

BABA caught my eye last Friday, after the skew (call iv - put iv) jumped almost 5 vol points, for reference BABA now has a larger skew than both ARKK and HOOD, which means it's pretty high. This is partly because of a huge put position opened up in the September 100 strike, potentially some kind of delisting bet. 

[BABA Skew](https://preview.redd.it/4w51nlgh19j71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fbcba957f83684548272d8522b34f5651ec270)

*Processing img dv2v0lyi19j71...*

&amp;#x200B;

This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, on one hand some fucker could know something we all don't and are expressing it with a largely convex positon, but on the other hand it could be some degenerate from this sub who robbed his wifes boyfriend a decided to spend it all on puts. Either way the outcome is the same, trend amplification.  This position could provide convexity to the downside and really put selling pressure on, or decay away and let BABA rally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Open Interest](https://preview.redd.it/23qn3ojm19j71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=014142383c8b1d266bcccce6f0389b15adac703f)

Of course, this isn't the only positioning, and if one wants to take a degenerate gamble on BABA, they probably should look into it more before they blow their entire life savings. A rough look at the volatility surface, it seems as if people are buying puts, and selling calls (maybe because the IV is high? idk who cares). Sentiment has fallen, people are concerned about China obviously and it shows, but the question here is it overcrowded?

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don't know if it is, StarMine gives BABA a 60/100 on the short squeeze score, whatever the fuck that means.  But as people pile into short positions, institutions have started buying with vengeance under the surface. If you have heard of dark pools or whatever, they arent a perfect indicator, and there is a lot of noise in single names. What could easily be happening here is dealers trying to hedge options positions while minimizing transaction costs, but I can't shake the volume. Usually if someone really needs to get out of a trade, they will use a lit exchange, however on Friday there was both massive volume prints within the dark pools and the lit exchanges, certainly worth noting.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways back on track, lets crunch some numbers. Since BABA decided to rally today, I didn't have time to build surfaces that give me the best estimate on positioning (although my models are probably pretty shit anyway) so I had to half-ass it. Also since I wanted to post this shitty DD tonight, I only had time to fetch the positioning for the September expiration, but there is certainly a lot of gamma expiring in the near dated weeklys, but since I am just doing shitty napkin math here, it will do. 

Just by a quick and easy calculation, for a $1 move in BABA dealers are forced to take around $44,709,772.82 of liquidity,  that is a massive amount (remember we are using September exp as a proxy). For reference BABA traded around 88,541,300 shares on Monday, obviously they didn't all trade at the same price and there are both buyers and sellers included in volume, but that would be around $14,260,461,778   

With regards to sensitivity of implied volatility, quick and easy estimate of BABA  is around $241,385,45.38 again a massive number for a single stock (but again my models are probably pretty shit lol). What does this mean? If a bunch of those puts come in the money, we are gonna have somewhat of a cushion and could even squeeze out a rally. There is reflexivity in the market and with dealers acting as liquidity takers, there is an opportunity for violent moves especially to the upside if it interacts with a short squeeze. 

Of course as I am writing this BABA is up 5% pre-market, what an absolute waste of time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pajoz4/dark_pools_liquidity_taker_some_shitty_baba_dd/,1.0

Here’s Why:

1. Members growth 110% YOY (now at 2.3M). SOFI rolled out a ton of credit card promotions and new account bonuses. If just 10% of wsb users sign up for the free money alone, that’s a 43% increase in their membership base, which would blow their quarterly metrics and analyst expectations out of the water.

2. App store Top #4 app: SoFi app was #122 May, #102 in June, #5 yesterday, and now #4.

3. Their Galileo platform services 70 million accounts (130% YOY growth) and is used by many major Fintech companies (Samsung, MoneyLion, Monzo, SoFi, Vala, Wise etc). Galileo is used by RobinHood and nearly all their transactions are processed through it.

4. So, if RobinHood does well, then SOFI should do equally well. HOOD is valued at 45 Billion, while SOFI is way undervalued at 13 Billion. With higher annual revenue and growth, SOFI should be near 25 Billion in my opinion; once people learn more about the company.

5. A friend of a friend who knows a friend that works at the company who’s also my friend, says they are actively working on options trading platform.

6. Bank charter status:  this is jet fuel to SOFI’s business allowing them to out compete and out tech anyone.  Expected by end of year or early next. Just a matter of time.

7. Cathie Wood will likely add SOFI to ARKK or ARKF in the near future. We know how much she loves SQ. SOFI should fit her funds perfectly; both high tech and high growth.  SoftBank is already a major investor in SOFI.

wallstreetbets,10730274,$SRNG aka Soaring Eagle Acuisition Corp. Aka Ginkgo Bioworks 🚀🚀🚀 a poor tard's DD,p1yqjv,crjlsm,1628630865,1,1,"Ladies, gentlemen, retards: allow me to regale you with the tale of a company that is poised to make us all more tendies than we could ever dream of shoving in our ass. 

*a SPAC? Are you retarded?* Yes. Yes I am. However, this is the same SPAC group that put out DraftKingz and Skillz Inc. They have a proven track record, for whatever that's worth. 

The target in question is Ginkgo Bioworks, a literal fucking unicorn, and the biggest biotech IPO since Moderna. I believe they are the biggest biotech IPO *ever*. They are set to merge in q3 21 (hint: that's now you idiots). There have been FUD articles questioning their valuation, but frankly they're bullshit and in my opinion they probably dont want a bunch of retards owning shares at NAV. Why? Because Ginkgo is not only unique in their IP, model, culture, and mission, but they are uniquely poised to capitalize unlike any other company in their sector. 

For the uninitiated, I will give you a brief rundown, replete with technical errors and devoid of anything coherent: Ginkgo is in a fledgling sub-sector of biotech called synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is concerned with reprogramming cells, usually bacteria or yeast or cum or whatever the hell, in order to make them produce something of interest. In other words, they can grow organic material like fragrances, mRNA-related compounds, practically fucking anything.

 What Ginkgo has that sets it apart from competitors is it's foundry and it's codebase. Their codebase has essentially turned DNA into a programming language, with cells being the hardware. The foundry is a highly automated setting where they can test this code at varying scales. 

Basically, they have what taiwan semi has, to the synthetic biology world. Companies go to ginkgo to test their product, and to scale it up. This is a rather time consuming and expensive process *usually*, which companies hire independent r&amp;d labs for, to varying degrees of success. Ginkgo allows the company access to their codebase and their foundry, and they work with them to scale it up. Ginkgo is not only a faster and more cost efficient route for companies to take, it has also had major success. Most importantly, ginkgo takes an equity stake in these companies, essentially making them partners. They have their hands in so many mind bendingly cutting edge things it's not even worth getting into here. Over the long term, this company will own a Softbank-esque portfolio of equity in the biotech space. 

But heres the play:

The issue has been computer traded to hell, stuck between 9.75 and 10.00 for months-until just recently. Volume began to pour in last week. ARKG purchased over 4m shares, and the next day ARKK purchased just under 2m shares. This week, ARKG purchased *another* 4m shares and ARKK doubled down the same. There has been a week of heavy inflow into the stock from ETFs, and I believe a merger is imminent. They have announced their first earnings call, August 18th, and the options have begun to move. Specifically, the August and September 10 strike calls. You'll notice the volume on these is pretty insane, and the contracts are gonna look cheap as hell if a merger goes through soon. 

Ticker is changing to DNA. For you superstitious idiots out there, this is indeed an auspicious ticker. Blessed by the gods, one could say. Predestined for greatness. This ticker was once held by Genentech, which if you ask your dad about he'll tell you they made investors massive tendies before getting acquired. 

Cathie is in, Bill Gates is in, my minimum wage ass is in,  give it a look.

wallstreetbets,10730090,Follow The Money - How To Catch Every Rotation And (Almost) Always Make Money,p1x0ls,tickerwizards,1628625639,478,1,"# I. Introduction

Sorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.

This sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite stocks (Except MVST - nice one there).

In my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships. 

Last year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.

# II. The Indices

The indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.

**S&amp;P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.""

Basically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).

**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. ""

These are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.""

These are going to be your ""boomer"" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&amp;P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&amp;P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).

**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.""

These are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations. 

These are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.

# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)

Moving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.

The primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.

**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**

Risk on is when you are going to see a rotation into ""risk assets"". People predicting inflation believe the Fed will raise rates and that inflation will continue to rise - so they are flowing into banks, energy, materials, value stocks and some Forex pairs - things that will benefit from more inflation, and things that perform better in a high interest rate environment.

Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent out. In a rising rate environment, banks benefit because they are still paying a lower interest on deposits, but making a greater spread on money lent out. 

Commodities and materials (energy) benefit from inflation for obvious reasons - they will scale as inflation increases.

Value stocks benefit here because people are **hunting for yield** \- this is the main point in a risk on environment. Value stocks **make money** and often pay it out via **dividends or share buybacks** which create value for shareholders. They also generally **aren't** **dependent on debt.** When rates rise - money becomes more expensive to borrow - and companies that depend on it will generally perform worse.

AUD/JPY is the main forex pair I watch for risk on moves. Basically - AUD = riskier currency, JPY = safe haven currency. As a result - when AUD/JPY is going up - money is likely flowing into risk assets.

Small caps generally perform well here because they are perceived to be riskier. Remember, risk on = money flowing to risk assets.

In a risk on environment **Dow Jones** will usually outperform. Remember that's where you find your boomer value names.

Equities as a whole will generally do well in a risk on environment. This gets a bit tricky when we are expecting a rate raise at any moment - but stocks in general are considered a hedge for inflation.

**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**

This is the exact opposite of risk on. Money flows out of risk assets and into safe assets. People predicting deflation believe current inflation expectations are overblown and the increase is transitory. They also think the Fed won't raise rates for a while. In general - **the fed lowers rates to stimulate economic activity and stave off deflation. Subsequently - money flows into safe haven assets and things that benefit from low interest rates and protect from deflation.** These are going to be your growth names, bonds, the dollar and the VIX.

Growth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. 

Bonds perform well because remember - investors are expecting **rates to fall** in this situation. If your coupon will be lower in the future - why wouldn't you buy now while it's still as high as it is. Not only that - but bonds are **safe haven assets -** they provide a fixed rate of return (unlike equities) - and so they are perceived to be much safer.

The dollar performs well because it is **the safe haven currency.** It's the worlds primary reserve currency - so in times of economic hardship people put their money there to protect it. Also - if we are **deflating** \- the dollar is gaining value.

The VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).

**In Summary**

&lt; *Risk On &gt;*

* Financials
* Commodities
* Value
* Materials
* AUD/JPY
* **Russell 2000**
* **Dow Jones**

&lt; *Risk Off &gt;*

* Bonds
* Growth
* Dollar
* VIX
* **Nasdaq 100**

# IV. Practical Applications

First let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation -

&lt; *Risk On &gt;*

* YM (DIA)
* RTY (IWM)
* CL (Crude Oil Futures)
* ZC (Corn Futures)
* AUD/JPY

*&lt; Risk Off &gt;*

* DXY (Dollar Index)
* ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds)
* TNX (10 Year Treasury Index)
* VIX (The ""Fear Index"")
* NQ (QQQ)
* ARKK (This is a bit newer and less common - but I find it useful to track speculative growth names that perform quite well in a deflationary environment)

Glancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.

Basically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.

For instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.

On the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.

***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***

[NQ \(QQQ\)](https://preview.redd.it/fdtd97r9fkg71.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e7c58fa94c018f4d6fb5b38585a4d474f77b5c6)

The red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq, tech, and risk off assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.

[TLT \(ZB\)](https://preview.redd.it/cuq89v4hfkg71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836d02a7fc13c175aebc93f080d705679b0b2f7c)

The red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.

I try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.

* **Indexes:** 3
* **Bonds:** 2
* **Everything Else:** 1

You will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money. The others are just if you want to filter your signals further or are unsure about a move.

# V. Divergences

Correlations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

# IV. TL;DR

The main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**

Also - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.

investing,1790136,What investors have learned one year since the stock market bottomed,mn0jp1,sueytext,1617913164,2,1,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are testifying Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the state of the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic.

Investors are expecting Powell to stick to the script — reiterate rates near zero for the next two years. But Powell and Yellen are also expected to be asked what, if anything, they learned about managing the biggest crisis since the Great Recession in 2007-2009.

The historic bottom one year ago
The S&amp;P 500 bottomed on March 23, 2020. From the mid-February 2020 high to that bottom, the S&amp;P dropped 34%, its biggest drop since the 50% decline in the Great Recession.

The big difference between now and then is the breathtaking speed of the recovery. In the earlier crisis, the S&amp;P did not return to its old high until February 2013, nearly six years later. In the case of the Covid drop, the S&amp;P returned to its February 2020 high six months later and is now up 75% from the bottom.
The Great Recession, of course, was a different kind of disaster than Covid, but the speed of this recovery was nonetheless breathtaking.

What accounted for the breathtaking recovery? Most traders cite the lessons the Fed learned from the earlier crisis. 

“The Fed had a  playbook from the last time around [the financial crisis], they accelerated it and sped everything up,” said Peter Cecchini of AlphaOmega Advisors. “They went really big ”

Cecchini noted that the Fed instituted a massive monetary stimulus program, cutting rates almost to zero, and unveiled plans for massive asset purchases. “The biggest difference was the primary and secondary lending facilities that intervened in the corporate bond market,” he said. “Even though they did not buy that much debt, the Fed said, ‘Corporate America, you can count on us. We will not let the corporate bond market implode.’ And that had a huge effect on confidence.”

Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, also credited science, which is not usually a factor in stock rallies: “The other good news is that this felt like a temporary thing, depending on getting a vaccine, whereas no one was sure how long the financial crisis was going to last.”

The Fed’s largess shows up in stocks
While all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P are well off that March 2020 low, the biggest movers are those sectors that were the most direct beneficiaries of the Fed and congressional largess: small caps, commodities and cyclicals like transports and industrials, what has come to be known as the “reflation trade.”

Major sectors since the bottom: reflation rules (since March 23, 2020)

Russell 2000 up 126%
Transports     up 108%
Banks            up 107%
Materials          up 93%
Energy            up 91%
Industrials       up 90% 
While technology has also done well (up 85%), consumer sectors have greatly lagged the reflation trade because those stocks benefit less from the reopening of the economy.

Defensive sectors lag the recovery (from 3/23/20 low)

Health care         up 47%
Consumer staples up 32%
Utilities                   up 30%
What investors are really invested in: Rapid change
Still, looking at returns since the bottom shows an even bigger trade than reflation. Call it the “rapid change trade.”

Investments in clean energy, online retail, lithium/battery, 3D printing, cybersecurity, have all exploded in the last year.

The “rapid change” trade? (from 3/23/20 low)

 Clean energy (PBW)   up 324%
Online retail (IBUY)     up 303%
ARK Innovation (ARKK)  up 231%
Lithium/battery (LIT)        up 217%
3D printing (PRNT)          up 166%
“Investors are betting that Covid is speeding up a tech transformation of the home and the workplace ... so investing in change is definitely a theme,” said Murphy.

Still, it seems a bit strange. You have the old school energy, brick and mortar, and industrials all rallying, and at the same time you have the high-tech, more speculative “rapid change trade.”

Can you have both? “Over time, one will prevail over the other, but right now, circumstances are such that there is room for both,” said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. “Think of all the new investors that have come into the market in the last year. The new money has gone into that thematic tech. That’s what happened in the late 1990s: a whole new crop of investors came in and were interested in tech. The old-school investors aren’t comfortable chasing that trend.”

Still, betting on everything speeding up also seems a safe bet for Jim Besaw, chief investment officer at GenTrust, who is one of many observers noting that the pace of change, the pace of trading, the pace of everything seems to have sped up in the last year: “Everything we previously believed would take months to happen now was going to happen in a matter of days/hours.”

Yellen and Powell
What will Powell and Yellen say about the lessons learned from managing the Covid crisis?

While Sosnick expects a wide discussion about inequality and the K-shaped recovery, he also expects a vociferous defense of going big with stimulus: “The Republicans I think will argue going big was right in the beginning, but did we really need to ‘go big’ now, with this latest stimulus, when we are more likely closer to the end than the beginning?”

Cecchini, who is writing a book about the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic, hopes Congress will push back on the increasingly aggressive behavior of the Fed during these crises. 

“There are situations where a coordinated fiscal and monetary response is warranted,” he said. 

“But if you are going to have these kinds of coordinated efforts in the future, there needs to be a more explicit involvement of Congress. There should be more oversight of the Fed when they resort to these kinds of big, broad programs.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mn0jp1/what_investors_have_learned_one_year_since_the/,1.0

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mij0s2/arkk_morningstar_review_unrestrained_unaware_and/,1.0
investing,1781808,FTC files suit against Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with Grail,mgwz1w,Social_History,1617160710,26,1,"In an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won’t go through.

I currently hold an extremely heavy tech portfolio and still believe it’ll be a good portfolio long term. However, the fact that it is quite centred on a specific sector reduces my sleep at night factor. 

I’m very young in investing terms so therefore am quite risk tolerant and have time to recover from tech sell offs etc, however I often think it would be so much easier having a 2/3 etf portfolio.

investing,1764042,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.",m6zzhm,akokaz1,1615986444,11,1,"Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6zzhm/research_on_teradyne_inc_a_stock_seeing_an/,1.0

DEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50.

1. Holding out on buying in hopes if it goes bad i get in on a huge dip today or tomorrow. Know after today that when they recover its going to be fine. Yesterdays green market should have showed everyone that tech isnt dead and will bounce right back. 

2. If i don't buy in and it goes well and everything recovers... it means im no longer in the red and tech will start making money again. 

Its a win win but also no idea what way itll go. 

I set some low buy orders just above the most recent lowest drop from a few days ago. Banking that its gonna drop once markets open as people take profits and wait for bond auction before buying back in. If i miss out and the stocks rocket ill catch them on the way up.

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon 
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations** 
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies  
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research** 

**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings): 
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment 
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future 
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency 
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency 
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation 
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon 

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 34% 
   * LTM gross margins: 71% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x 
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising 
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 46% 
   * LTM gross margins: 48% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x 
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies 
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 27% 
   * LTM gross margins: 87% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%) 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x 
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data. 
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 34% 
   * LTM gross margins: 57% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x 
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain 
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15% 
   * LTM revenue growth: 33% 
   * LTM gross margins: 53% 
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% 
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x 
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m037w1/arkk_innovation_fund_top_5_stock_picks_week/,1.0

investing,1713831,I Want To Talk About Telehealth,lpq85b,lucinabeach10Iu,1614006442,68,1,"Haven’t really seen much about telehealth, so I thought I’d put my 2 cents in on what I’ve been looking at and what I’ve found. I'm not going to run through why telehealth is bigger now than it was before 2020. It's obvious. 

So, I've been checking out all the telehealth companies, specifically AMWL, since they’ve been booming and I’m wondering if anyone has found anything different.

Here are the players I’m looking at right now: AMWL, TDOC, CVS, ANTM; with my primary focus being on AMWL. 

AMWL: Full disclosure, I’ve been heavily following them since their Q3 earnings call. Launched its IPO in Sept. 2020 where it was $18 and had a three month high of $42. Stock is currently trading just under $30, and IMO is highly undervalued. Results from Q3 show that the company had more than 1.4 million virtual visits, a 450% increase from the same period in 2019. Revenue from Q3 was $62.6 million, an 80% increase. From what I’ve been seeing, I'm expecting an increase from the Q4 results as well. I dug up some info, and it’s got an investment of $100 million from Google. Also a partnership with Cleveland Clinic, and a recently launched telepsychiatry service, so there must be something here with large interest from these companies. It’s still at an attainable price and my thoughts are, since the telehealth industry is booming, this looks like the next one to grow. 

TDOC: If you don’t know, TDOC had it’s IPO in July of 2015 at $19 a share and now hovers in the $280s. TDOC’s 5-year trend shows that telehealth stocks haven’t JUST been growing because of the pandemic. TDOC has been growing for years, with a 179% stock price increase between its IPO in 2015 and November of 2019. This could be because it was the main player for so long (founded in 2002) and the only health service looking to the future of technology in health for some time. Q4 earnings aren’t yet announced, as none of the others have announced either, but I don’t know if I should bother this late in the game to invest. Short-term signals are positive.

CVS: The company started trading under the ticker we all recognize in 1996, but CVS didn’t enter the telehealth market until 2018 through a partnership with the big guy above, TDOC. CVS saw a 600% increase in its MinuteClinic virtual visits from Q1 of 2019 to Q2 of 2020. It’s got a tumultuous history, so that’s probably why it’s currently undervalued. But is it going to keep growing? It seems extremely diverse as a pharmacy and it bought out Aetna a couple years ago, so now a healthcare provider as well. But it just fell, again, so is this still a solid stock? From what I’m reading, the long-term health of the stock is still trying to find a solid footing. 

ANTM: this is an independent licensee of BCBS and is the 5th largest publicly traded health benefits company in the US. Its origins go back to the 40’s as Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc. After years of mergers and growth, it went public in 2001 and then expanded into the telehealth sphere in 2018. ANTM opened in Oct 2001 at $20.25. I’m reading that it looks like Q4 is going to have a below average return. I am seeing that some are saying that it may be undervalued but from what I’m reading the stock is in the middle of a falling trend in the short term. There are also expectations that it’s supposed to fall up to 5.57% more in the next few months. 

Some thoughts: TDOC is part of the EDOC ETF which recently launched last summer. Solid ETF choice that’s seen a 28% growth in the last 3 months. We see SO MUCH about ARKK, but I’m thinking EDOC is overlooked. My thoughts: getting into EDOC to mitigate risk, and investing individually in AMWL. 

TLDR: no brainer: telehealth is up, but I’m hyped on AMWL. Best-in-class technology stack, huge partner investments, incredible price upside, major revenue increases with what looks to be a positive Q4 earnings call. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/,1.0

Also done analysis on my portfolio performance and strategy for the following months:

&amp;#x200B;

I have now under my eyes the following stocks with new orders for the reasons on each I hope will help you.

&amp;#x200B;

$BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway Inc) because I want to see how the buybacks work and if are they worth it more than dividends for tax reasons and because is the one really well-known stock that is having excellent performance in the past years, since the fair price is at $237.12 being overvalued in 2.3% I placed my order at $240.

&amp;#x200B;

$ULVR.L (Unilever) is a stock that I know really well from working with the company in the past and is a UK stock and since the UK markets are on all times low I wanted to grab the opportunity to expose my portfolio a bit more to the $UK100 and this is a good opportunity to get it right now.

&amp;#x200B;

$ILMN (Illumina) Illumina is the leader in short sequencing and number 1 in the overall (some call them the next Amazon in their sector) and I need my portfolio to be exposed to Biotech, but I’m waiting for the correct at $400 since the fair price is at $383 and is overvalued in 31.8%, placing my order at $400

&amp;#x200B;

$QCOM (Qualcomm Inc) since QualComm is one of the leaders in terms of 5G and I needed my portfolio to have exposure to 5G but since the fair price is at $96.24 being overvalued in 53.8% I placed my order at $125.

&amp;#x200B;

$[0700.HK](https://0700.HK) (Tencent) Tencent is the Chinese $FB (Facebook) and they are investing heavily in AI and with this stock, I kill two birds with one stone, be more exposed to the Chinese Market and have also AI exposure but I\`m waiting for the correction since the fair price is at HK$500.84 being overvalued in 51.1% that’s why I placed my order at HK$600.

&amp;#x200B;

This has seemed like the best decision to me over the past 2 or 3 years, ever since I started reading authors like JL Collins and Ramit Sethi, who present a conservative and “practical” approach to wealth accumulation (i.e. 8-11% returns over the long-term).

But lately I’m seeing the returns on tech-focused funds like ARKK and wondering if I’m missing out. 

Yeah, the S&amp;P 500 is probably gonna keep churning out ~10% returns, but it seems silly to keep thinking that’s the best way to do things when there are other diversified funds delivering 3x those numbers. 

All-in-all, it feels like the investing landscape is changing and the tried-and-true conservative approach might become the equivalent of staying in the slow lane for a very long car trip.

That being said, I’m wondering: Would it be reasonable to allocate 25-50% of my 401(k) to these high-growth ETFs? And do they require more maintenance, or can I keep them mostly on autopilot like Vanguard funds?

Perspectives from seasoned investors would be much appreciated. Really just want to know if there are any significant downsides to this approach.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmr01y/target_date_funds_vs_highgrowth_etfs/,1.0

investing,1689264,SPCE DD - Test Flight Delay,lktgg1,hooman_or_whatever,1613442162,53,5,"Hello all!

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Key Staff and Players:**

Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

**Noteworthy Investors**:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America  
Morgan Stanley  
ARK  
Boeing  
Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)

**Partners**:  
Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

investing,1688671,"Investing in ""Innovation""",lkq58h,Connect-Pain-2328,1613431653,37,1,"There's been so much talk about ""innovation"" nowadays that I'm losing track of where it came from, and especially a growing popularly among investors. Funds like ARKK (Ark Innovation ETF), KOIN ( Innovation Shares Next Gen Protocol),  XITK (SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology) are some prominent examples with literally the word ""innovation"" in their fund name.

**My question is what exactly are we investing in when we invest in ""innovation"" or ""disruptive technology"" or whatever fancy terminologies they use nowadays?** 

I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way but it seems like they're just terms we throw around without fully comprehending what it means. One possibility is that ""innovation"", for the case of investing in them, refers to the company/firm's potential to create new product or services to enter the market, or even creating an entire niche market entirely. But how exactly do we quantify it? At least to me it seems like these funds (and myself) are basing it on news and articles, which imo are all opinionated and subjective. Shouldn't we be basing it on hard facts or some form of quantitative research?

investing,1686143,"Theory Crafted a New Portfolio Allocation, Thoughts Welcome!",lkaodv,PersonaQs,1613383590,26,1,"A taxable account has roughly 40k, saved and invested over since I got my first paycheck 8 months ago.

I have been going with the flow and investing in stock tips from the Motley Fool and heavily following ARK invest. I have some positions that are up crazy amounts, but overall my portfolio is up 30% since June. Comparing it with the S&amp;P 500, I am dead even in performance.

I have been wanting to create an optimal portfolio that fits my demands. I have spent the last week taking a Portfolio Management course from MIT on MIT's OpenCourseware website. I have been learning about statistical modeling, risk parity, modern portfolio theory, and some other cool stuff.

While learning, I decided I want to try and beat ARKK's portfolio (\~117% returns last year). My thought process is that ARKK, being an ETF, has government restrictions on weights/allocations that they can hold in the portfolio. My argument is that as an individual investor, it may be possible to run risk-parity models to have an optimized weighted ARK portfolio.

In further research, I came across the 7Twelve allocation model.

""**7Twelve** is a multi-asset balanced portfolio developed by [**Craig L. Israelsen, Ph.D.**](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2F7twelveportfolio.com%2FAboutUs.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cabecker%40mail.citadel.edu%7Cd5e493e74a27438f7ad708d8d1970e23%7C960c1081d06341f8844b41d738db04a3%7C0%7C0%7C637489794425232832%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=BB5uEDVvxG9Rs%2FJy6M8kHVz6H8CC0mzUl%2BHdlXT%2BimI%3D&amp;reserved=0) in 2008. Unlike a traditional two-asset 60/40 balanced fund, the **7Twelve** balanced strategy utilizes multiple asset classes to enhance performance and reduce risk.

The ***7*** of **7Twelve** represents the suggested number of asset classes to include in your portfolio. The ***Twelve*** represents the **12** separate mutual funds or exchange traded products to fully represent the **7** asset classes in your **7Twelve** portfolio.""

The 51-year standard deviation of return for the multi-asset portfolio of 10.15% is roughly 40% smaller than the 16.89% standard deviation of the S&amp;P 500 Index (meaning it is 40% less volatile) – yet the 51-year 9.51% average annual return of the multi-asset portfolio is only 12% smaller than the 10.75% return of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

With this finding and my original idea, I came up with an asset allocation that I wish to try as opposed to solely making investment decisions off of recommendations from others.

I want to model a traditional 60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio. However, instead of Bonds, I want to 40% of my portfolio to follow this 7Twelve model.

The 7Twelve Model in my portfolio will be broken down as follows:

8.33% Large US : 10 Large Cap ETFs

8.33% Mid US : 10 Mid Cap ETFs

8.33% Small US : 10 Small Cap ETFs

8.33% Non-US : 10 International ETFs

8.33% Emerging Markets : 10 Emerging Market ETfs

8.33% Real Estate: 10 REITS

8.33% Natural Resources : 10 Natural Resource ETFs

8.33% Commodities : 10 Commodities ETFs

8.33% High Yield US Bonds: 10 HYB ETFs

8.33% Inflation Protected Bonds: 10 IP Bonds ETFs

8.33% Non-US Bonds: 10 Non-US Bonds ETFS

8.33% Cash

As for 60% stocks, I am considering 25% ARK/other tech ETFs , 25% individual tech stocks, and 10% Bitcoin (implementing a Kelly Strategy with Bitcoin here).

As far as respected returns, YTD data that I modeled shows I can expect my 40% 7Twelve allocation to return 4.5% minimum and 7.79% maximum. (Plan to rerun these calculations with 3 month, 1 year, and 3 year data sets soon).

My 60% expected returns of ETFs, Stocks, and Bitcoin will require more calculations.

I am making this post to ask if anyone has ever seen, or dare I ask tried, a strategy similar to this. For some background, I am a recent Computer Science graduate with minors in Cybersecurity, Statistics, and Mathematics. I currently work in IT, and very clearly see the vision set forth by many of the Tech companies I invest in. I am also 22 and very far ahead of my peers in terms of personal finance, so I am willing to take the risk on trying this allocation.

Would love to hear some thoughts/feedback!

**TLDR: I am convinced an argument can be made that ARK's portfolio can be beaten by an individual with an optimized portfolio using Risk-Parity (due to government regulations on ETFs). I will hold 25% allocation of ARK until I calculate out a testable solution.**

**I am convinced that the 7Twelve allocation can replace 40% bonds in a tradtional 60/40 Stock Bond split. The 7Twelve allocation should yield more returns than bonds (historically comparable to S&amp;P500), and offers far more diversification.**

**I want to design a portfolio that leverages these two arguments to try and beat ARK's performance with my 60% stocks/etfs and significantly reduce risk and maximize reward with my 40% 7Twelve allocations.**

Planning to go long, say 15-20 years.

ARKK has had great year so far but will the momentum die?

BTCC is pretty speculative, but bitcoin seems to be on a tear lately.

So my (maybe not so rational question) is: What sounds better? Purchase mutual funds and forget about it for the next 15-20 years OR Trade ETFs that are on the riskier side of the scale for the next 15-20 years.

Are there any other good ETFs that are in same category (innovation / high growth) as those listed above that you can recommend?

My fiancé and I  sold and bought a house this past year. We put down 20% and was able to pocket 30k on top from the sale. We locked in at 2.7% interest for a 30 year loan. 

I was initially thinking about putting the additional 30k on the principal but now rethinking. I’ve been looking into funds like ARKK and VOO for possible investment. Thinking that the return is higher than the 2.7% interest rate.  

A little more background.  I max out my Roth every year. And I have another 30k in my rainy day fund. 

I feel I’m getting more from my money by investing... am I right ?

investing,1655278,Use a Roth IRA to retire a millionaire,lhmrxl,SeanVo,1613056586,891,1,"If you're in the US, A Roth IRA allows you to invest after tax money (that is money that is already sitting in your bank account, you've already paid taxes on it through your employer), and then it grows tax free and can be taken out in retirement tax free. For most people, it's absolutely the best vehicle to use for growth. Max it out each year and don't take any out until retirement.

As an example, let's say you're 30. You have 30+ years to retirement. If markets behave as they have on average, your portfolio should double more than 4 times over that time. If you were in a traditional IRA, that 1600%+ growth would be taxed at your tax rate in retirement when you take it out with distributions. If you invested in a Roth IRA, all that growth is yours to keep, tax free.

Here's an example using [this calculator](https://www.investingfees.com/calc/investment/).

Start with $10,000. Invest an additional $6,000 each year. Earn 10% each year (a [reasonable](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/) [estimate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return) for long term returns). Repeat for 30 years. At the end of 30 years, you'll have invested $190,000. You'll have accumulated $**1,161,458.16**. If you used a traditional IRA, you would have saved some taxes on that $190,000 you put in, however you'll be paying tax on all the gains when you take the money out. If you used a Roth, you would enjoy that $1,161,458 tax free in retirement. It's worth noting inflation will reduce the buying power of that sweet $1M+...all the more reason to be invested and keep all the growth you can get.

Where to invest if you're just starting out? I'd suggest Vanguard with a low-cost index ETF like ""VTI."" Young and/or want to take on more risk in hopes of higher returns? Consider putting a portion in ETF's like VGT, ARKK, QCLN, or any other sectors you think will outperform the market.

Hope that helps. Get your kids to start a Roth as soon as they have a job. Compound growth were the first words I tried to teach my kids. I was still happy with ""dada.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhmrxl/use_a_roth_ira_to_retire_a_millionaire/,1.0

Lets say you can get a basically free loan (less than ~3% rate which is common in europe)

I was looking at pros vs cons of taking the money and invest it in active ETF in a lump sum (aka arkk)


Pros
- technically earning more than 2.5% on the investment will make me money
- I wont need the money in the near future (or - I will be able to pay for it from my salary)
Basically free money

Cons
- ETF might go down, not necessarily as the rate of an index ETF (may be even greater)
-no DCA as its one sum
- As i can pay it from my salary, i can just to it monthly and prevent some of the risks (but lose some of the potential gains

As mentioned above, I am looking to invest at 55 years old. I have been reading a lot of Roth IRA accounts for both my wife and I, and while we can both max out our accounts with some more to spare, I am wondering if this is a viable investment strategy to meet my retirement goal. Personally, being eligible to pull from your retirement accounts at 59 1/2 with no penalty is pretty daunting for me. I want to enjoy my money early in life, not wait until I am almost senior citizen age.

Is there something about a Roth IRA I am missing, or is the only viable early retirement strategy to invest in individual stocks in a brokerage account? As for my brokerage account, I am heavily invested into VOO and ARKK, and have recently made a good amount on GameStonk which I donated most of it to a friend in need. For the long-term, I plan to continue heavily investing into VOO and ARKK, and using a small amount  for fun trading. 

Another question that I have is if it is a viable strategy to max out 401k and a Roth IRA and just take on the penalty whenever I want to retire prior to 59 1/2.

investing,1841063,My long term portfolio and strategy - please read!!,nhzlhe,putsonbears,1621622267,6,1,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

Thus my parents, and even now, my friends back in my country consider the stock market to be volatile, risky and basically a gamble. And as you can imagine, you keep money in the bank, and you get money from that, without any risk.

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one.

investing,1831094,Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance History,nabnrv,cr0ne,1620778132,663,1,"How could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&amp;P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major**outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in a hedge fund that appears to have crash and burned.

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style is has squarely fit into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&amp;P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category average for the year.

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available)and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages to another benchmark (this is an average of of active fund performance, after fees).

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 billion in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/&gt;)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/&gt;)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/&gt;)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/&gt;)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

**2001: Cathie OUTPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix: Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index).

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) and IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000). In 2015 ARKK underperformed both.

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estiamted Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

&lt;https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position&gt;

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark exceeded $100 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targest significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme. You see, it's actually quite easy:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth (i.e. 40% annual).

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? Until the growth in the company revenue eventually meets up to meet the price? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

investing,1830990,Smart IRA/Investments as Gov. Employee making $52k?,na8e2l,poopfeast89,1620768877,2,1,"Thanks for taking a peek, I am trying to plan out my savings/investments to better prepare for a comfortable life with my wife and appreciate any help.

My current gross income, at a local government agency, is $52k/yr, before 22% tax. We are in our early 30s and reside in Florida, USA, putting retirement around 2055. She is a home maker at the moment while she studies, and currently our rent is not a concern.

I am saving as much as possible, most of our money goes to food, at $600/mo for two adults. We also have two large breed dogs, and two paid off cars. No other debt/big expenses right now. We are unable to file jointly right now because my wife's legal status is pending.

I have a healthcare plan with my job that includes vision, dental, and a health savings account account setup. I have not set up my 457b yet, but  there is no employer match. I do also benefit from a pension and union, if I keep my job.

I have $12,000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA that I have not invested yet, and $3,000 in an Individual account with Vanguard as well. I was thinking about doing 100% VTSAX in the Roth IRA and 100% VTWAX in the taxable individual  account. I would buy when it goes down a little more, as they seem like they will dip a bit soon. Are these good investments and or ratios?

I also have $12,000 in an Ally savings account with .50% APY, and $6,000  in various stocks ($3,000 in ARKK :/) with a Fidelity Individual account. I don't see much a choice right now other than holding until  there is profit to be made.

I plan on saving as much as possible, keeping a few months of emergency funds in a savings account, and investing the rest for at least a year. Then I  would sell investments if I needed something  like a down payment for a house.

Is this a good plan? Again, I really appreciate and welcome any input.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/na8e2l/smart_irainvestments_as_gov_employee_making_52k/,1.0
investing,1830331,Harvesting my Ark ETF losses,n9txvm,Investnew,1620729117,38,1,"I've been giving this a lot of thought and I'm looking for some opinions.

I've been reading about [tax loss harvesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp)

Short version is that you can use losses to offset your tax liability on gains.  

**Important:**  You can't immediately buy back a stock you sell at a loss for 30 days, but this doesn't apply to ETFs.  You could, for instance, harvest the loss on a S&amp;P 500 ETF like IVV and immediately buy a different S&amp;P 500 ETF like VOO to keep the same exposure.  

I've been thinking about how I might do this with my Ark funds that have taken a beating during this tech crash.

Let me give you a real example:   

* I sold some stock recently that had $30,000 short-term gains.   I'm going to owe 24% tax on that ($7200).  

* I'm currently down $30,000 on my ARK ETFs.  If I were to sell those right now, the $30,000 loss would offset the $30,000 gain... **and I would save $7200 in taxes.**
 
So the risk there, I guess, is that the ARK funds will shoot back up and I'll miss the gains (though more realistically it'll just keep dropping cuz tech is crashing).   Remember, I can't buy back the ARK funds for 30 days or it would trigger a wash sale.   

My initial thinking was... well, maybe I can just buy a similar tech-heavy ETF immediately after selling ARK.  That way, if Tech rebounds, I can ride it back up.  Or, alternatively, if tech continues to drop I'd just sell that ETF 30 days from now, harvest those losses as well, and buy back ARK.

Problem is, I wasn't really seeing any ETFs that mirror ARK.   

My Plan B is this... what if I just look at ARK's actual holdings (for instance, with ARKK you can see the 58 stocks and their weighting [here](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf)) and just buy the individual stocks with the same weighting?  In theory, this seems like it would be relatively easy for me to do with a spreadsheet.  If I am holding $10,000 worth of ARKK and know that Roku makes up 5.2%, I just buy $520 worth of Roku.... and do a similar thing with the other 57 stocks.  

30 days from now, I'd be able to sell all the individual stocks and buy back my $10,000 of ARKK.   

That way, I'm literally holding the exact same exposure so that if ARKK rebounded in the next 30 days, I'd ride it up while still saving $7500 in taxes due to the loss harvesting.  

I suppose the next issue would be that ARKK is actively managed and could see stocks sold/bought over the next 30 days, but I could probably manually handle mirroring that, right?  And really, the main thing I'm trying to account for is the entire tech sector rebounding within the next month, which is pretty unlikely as-is.  

Thoughts?  Tell me why this is a bad idea.  Tell me why you ARK bagholders aren't doing the same thing.

investing,1828285,[Data for D.D] $PLTR: Palantir's valuation is NOT expensive among its high growth SaaS peers,n8ehcq,AlteregoMike,1620567684,11,1,"I am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your ""seeing stone"" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:  


\- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **not overpriced** among peers.  
[https://twitter.com/MikeyJia/status/1390853384094289922/photo/1](https://twitter.com/MikeyJia/status/1390853384094289922/photo/1)

\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.

\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.

\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \~600. I heard that HFs might still wait for earning to confirm the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk. (Please note the institution holding data is not in real time. SEC requires 13F to be filed within 45 days after each quarter ends, so most funds will file their 21'Q1 holding by May 15)    
[https://twitter.com/MikeyJia/status/1390867459914223619](https://twitter.com/MikeyJia/status/1390867459914223619)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning BEFORE market. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**

\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR &amp; 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat &amp; raise. There is certainly short term hype &amp; risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**

\- As of May 9, **130.8M worth of contracts signed** this year with U.S Gov for PLTR

investing,1826523,Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns,n7cmlw,vgambhir,1620431992,300,1,"Recent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ?

Hello /r/investing I was wondering what I should do in regards to my Roth IRA, basically I am focused growth, with plans to retire at age 55-62 depending on how everything goes (IE I hit whatever number I feel is appropriate I am done). Currently I have about 9K in my Roth IRA, and 11K in my 401k,  with plans to move much of that 401k money into my Roth so it can be maxed out.

My main questions are what exactly should I read to have more confidence in what I am doing, what should I be investing in, and should I use their roboinvestor (Even with the fees).

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of my options are:

1. Switch to the Robo advisor, with its 0.35% fee, which seems beatable to me, but I and all of my family use Chase, so it would be convenient, and I do already kinda like YouInvest. I think vanguard is like 10% of this rate fwiw, so it seems suboptimal, although I am taking on a lot of risk managing things myself.
2. Buy mutual funds via my Chase account, my understanding is that I will not be charged a fee whatsoever for these trades \[Source: [https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing](https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing)\] and this would only charge me whatever fee the mutual fund charges.
   1. I would presumably go with something like  TTIIX, as that is what my job put my 401k into, although they also underperformed the SP500 by quite a bit. Their fee is  0.100% \[Source: [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote)\]
   2. I could also just buy VTSAX, that seems like a semi-reasonable plan.
3. Continue my manual buying of stocks and mutual funds I like, regardless of how risky it seems.
   1. This seems dangerous to me, my current intuition on stocks has me about at the following ratios.
      1. 40% SPYG
      2. 25% VTSAX and the Schwab equivalent (I was YouTube researching on separate days and both ended up suggested.
      3. 15% ARKK

investing,1821489,Recommended ARK funds to invest in for long term?,n44bmw,droesw,1620068469,3,1,"I’m looking to invest in ARK funds to hold for the long term, but I’m struggling to decide on which ones to put my money into. Should I just split my money between each individual ARK fund that’s available, or are there a select few you’d recommend for long term holdings? Considering buying in both my Roth IRA and my regular taxable account.

I probably see ARKK and ARKG recommend the most online, but some of those posts are months old so I’m not sure if the outlook of all the ARK funds has changed much since then.

investing,1821023,How do ETFs initially get priced?,n3rmij,Johnny_Yukon,1620032640,35,1,"Hi r/investing,

When SPY first came on the scene in 1993, it was priced around $44 (from what I’ve researched). My question is, how did that number come to be?

I’ve been doing a bit of research into ETF pricing. I understand that ETF prices are determined by their daily NAV (unless I’m mistaken here), but how does the initial figure get decided on? Because an ETF float isn’t capped per se, I’m finding it hard to understand versus a regular stock.

As a sidebar, I’d also love to know how/if this is different to actively managed ETFs like ARKK, for example. How did they set their initial price of around $20 and how does the price get influenced day to day?

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n3rmij/how_do_etfs_initially_get_priced/,1.0

Particularly, I’ve been trying to understand how the stock price of Ark is correlated with the performance of the fund:

1. Does $ARKK’s price movement reflect the averaged ownership of its holdings?

2. When $ARKK buys or sells stock, it will have some realized gains and losses. How would these realized gains or losses affect its stock price?

3. When investor buys $ARKK shares, do those money deploy right away for Ark to purchase the underlying holdings?

4. Does $ARKK’s price an indication of the performance of trades/ gains/ losses made by Ark? What other factors would exist?

5. Is it in theory possible that Ark is making consistently good trading decisions and making realized gains and yet $ARKK price would fall?

Looking at ARKK annual percentile returns (via Morningstar, performance percentile vs peers):

2015: 75th 
2016: 98th 
2017: 1st 
2018: 17th 
2019: 57th 
2020: 1st 
2021: 100th

ARKK is selling themselves as alpha generators, but they don’t consistently capture alpha. In fact, These kind of swings implies that the fund has excessive risk not excessive skill. Market does well, fund does great; market does poorly, fund tanks. Leverage is totally fine but it’s cheap, especially these days.  if they are just loading up on volatility then it’s not worth the management fee. You can get that on your own.

investing,1301314,Critique my Non-Taxable Portfolio,l4csjt,EschewObfuscation21,1611538309,1,1,"I didn't start saving for retirement until maybe my 7th year of my career (I'm a lawyer).  Against others' advice, I focused on paying off my $280k in student loans before I started saving.  Today I'm debt free and own my \~$500k condo outright (paid it off a year ago).  Old 401k rolled over to an IRA which I manage myself, and my current job has a 401k with Vanguard.  Together these are my non-taxable accounts.  I plan to max out my 401k every year for at least the next 15 years, and then I have separate investments (taxable brokerage account, rental property, etc).  I am trying to set myself up for an early semi-retirement, but  want to avoid  tapping into any of my 401k/IRA retirement savings until I'm forced to start taking distributions.  I'm 37, so these investments will have about 33 years to grow and that's why I want them to be aggressive.  So here's what I'm interested in: I know everyone says to consider your portfolio as a whole, but I want to consider my non-taxable accounts separately because I know they are on a different time horizon.  I also know that many people are pro just investing in a handful of ETFs/funds and would probably balk at mine being ""messy.""  But throwing everything into VOO or VTI is just too boring for me and want to learn more about investing by doing.  I also have a few stocks in these accounts just to play around with some dividend stocks/REITs in my non-taxable account.  Anyway, seems like there's a lot of people out there who like to analyze and critique so, anyone who wants to, please let me know your thoughts.

investing,1299208,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,l3z5jq,swaggymedia,1611493796,28,1,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

investing,1299056,ETF Savings Plan and ETF (Entry) advice,l3xuuf,xPxxxTx,1611488058,2,1," Hi all,

I  m kinda newbie, but would like to start building some wealth. Briefly  about me: I currently have 2000€ to invest and save monthly about 200€.I  have the following plan and appreciate some of your input!

1. I'd  like to save 1 ETF monthly with the 200€ and a low risk treshhold. Thus  I chose MSCI World Index (e.g. iShares Core MSCI World UCITS).  Alternatively, I find the MSCI World SRI charming. Any major pro/con for  either or do u have better alternatives for low risk ETF?
2. The  2000€ and possibly further money I'd like to invest in other ETFs with  higher risk tolerance. I am interested in: ARKK, iShares Global Clean  Energy UCITS, iShares MSCI EM UCITS, BOTZ, DRIV, IXC, SNSR. What do you  think of those or do you have better alternatives?
3. 3.  right now I find the market situation a bit critical, because  everything seems quite pumped up. On the other hand, you often read that  this trend is more likely to continue in the short term due to global  stimulus programs. As I understand it, though, for an ETF savings plan,  it's not so much the entry point that matters? With the other ETFs, is  there anything that speaks against getting started?

Thank you a lot in advances i really appreciate any advice!

investing,1298138,My portfolio - Am I doing the right thing?,l3qajh,Drexler8411,1611454600,6,1,"I’m struggling with my decisions regarding my portfolio. 

My quick background: 54 year old teacher. Retiring in 2024. I’ll get a pension of $4500 per month the rest of my life. 

Other than my pension, I have investments totaling $22,000. I contribute to a Roth 457, a Roth IRA, and an HSA. I currently invest $1500 per month, maxing out my HSA and Roth, with the rest going into the 457. 

This where I am second guessing myself. 

My HSA &amp; Roth:

40% - FSKAX - Total Stock Market 
10% - FZILX - Total International Market 
10% - FISVX - Small Cap Value 
20% - ARKK - Innovation
20% - ARKG - Genomic Revolution

My 457:

60% - FSKAX - Total Stock Market
20% - FSSNX - Small Cap Blend
10% - FSPSX - Total International Market
10% - FXNAX - Total Bond Market

I’m comfortable with my 457. All index funds. Totally confident. 

My HSA and Roth is obviously aggressive. I love what ARK has to offer, to the tune of 40% of my allocation. This is my worry. Is this too much? I subscribe to the thought process that my secure pension are my bonds, and my other investments are my stocks. Thus, the reason I am so aggressive. Not to mention I got a late start investing as I previously always thought all I needed was my pension, and didn’t even know I could invest in addition to my pension. I guess you could say I’m trying to make up for lost time. 

I would love to hear what some of you think. I guess I feel 40% in ARK might be too high, but then again, my pension should be enough to support my lifestyle. And, my 457 is all index funds. 

I really appreciate any input. Thanks so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l3qajh/my_portfolio_am_i_doing_the_right_thing/,1.0

New to ETF investing and have compiled my own list.

For instance, let's say as an American resident you wanted targeted exposure to the Canadian markets, so you bought [XIC.TO](https://XIC.TO), or you wanted to buy a Canadian company directly like Nortel (hehe).

Now in 2021, Cathie has revealed a brand new ETF called ""ARK Space Exploration"", whose ticker symbol is ARKX. Here is [video](https://youtu.be/At-OnBlsMfY) summarizing the N-1A filing of ARKX - I hope it will be useful to everyone:

ARKX will go public some time after 3/29/2021.

Theme: Invest in companies that are engaged in leading, enabling, or benefitting from products/services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.

ARKX has 4 investment categories: Orbital Aerospace, Suborbital Aerospace, Enabling Technologies, and Aerospace Beneficiary.

Risk Factors:

1. Concentrate (&gt;25% of the fund’s assets) in industrial sector and information technology sector.
2. Currency risk: a strong US dollar will negatively affect the fund due to the non-US stock holding in the fund.
3. Aerospace and Defense industry is heavily depending on US government’s demand and other government’s demand around the world.
4. Newly offered fund. No performance history is available.

Upside:

1. Credibility: Cathie Wood and the success of ARK Invest ETFs (ARKK, ARKQ, …)
2. Promising of incredible return
3. The fund’s portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated daily.

investing,1283707,My portfolio for the next 10 years.,kywcad,dog34421,1610847131,23,1,"
Here’s my current breakdown after recent rebalancing. I used to be 40% in clean energy etfs at the March lows and just sold alot of them. Ive been trading in and out of ICLN, QCLN and PBW since 2009. This is the 3rd multiyear swing trade I’ve been involved with them resulting in 100% or more gains. Right now i think alt energy needs a 30% drop to shake out alot of new late money coming from hype posts on reddit and elsewhere. All of a sudden everyone knows they’re a great bet after 300% up but very few here were saying buy them in March and NOBODY on CNBC was saying buy them at any time between March and now. Only last month have i been hearing CNBC heads talking about them. Great timing!
I know everyone here loves shit like VT but i don’t waste my time(or my opportunities) with it as i do not trade China/HK, India or Russia stocks and don’t want to invest directly in their entire market aside from the stocks from China that are in some of my etfs below like for example NIO is in a few of my etfs

I trade around a core position in all of these as they outperform i move money to underperformers every few weeks or months.

21% - EWC and BBCA - Canada - Canada has a 1.5% annual population growth rate. That is 3x the US rate of 0.5%. Nobody on CNBC talks about Canada or Australia which is my next biggest holding. They will all be hyping them eventually when they look for growth and “suddenly” realize theres 2 continent sized countries with stable governments and educated people rich in natural resources and rich in natural beauty with a currently small population with massive growth potential. They also have excellent immigration systems of bringing in people based on merit, education and skills required.
Canada in particular is gaining new previously mostly frozen land as the world warms. Endless amounts of land for actual humans to live on and  land with nat resources.

17% - EWA - Australia - also a 1.5% population growth rate that is scheduled to continue at that pace for the next 10 years at least.

Only downside to my Canada and Australia etfs is they are 33% financials which i hate but i like the rest of the sector weights they have and that weighting can change if their industrials and  tech cos become bigger just like financials in the SP500 became a way smaller % weight since 2008. 

22% - Technology etfs listed in order from biggest position to smallest. I believe alot of money will come out of bloated big tech like Facebook and at the same time big tech will continue to buy small tech cos. Facebook bought 80 companies in the last few years. When boomer morons on CNBC are saying sell tech to buy banks i know i should buy more tech. With tech to me valuations are often meaningless. You are investing in groups of smart brains/thinktanks. You are actually betting on 1 or more of them inventing a time machine( or other huge advancements) one day and that stock and any etf holding it opening the next day up INFINITE %. What will the banks invent? A better way to extract money from all of us as they get free fake newly printed money from the Federal Reserve? 
I also consider clean energy etfs to basically be tech but i will list them separately.

This year, if ARK performs only half of what it did in 2020, a $100,000 investment today would become $200,000 by end of year.

1. In 2020 they avg roughly 200% growth... which would make 100k into 300k with month over month compounding growth.
2. Their performance in 2020 demonstrates they can not only survive but thrive through a downturn.
3. ARK shares openly share their trades daily and Cathie Wood has become such a household name, that people literally pour into any company she invests in... significantly appreciating the equity.
4. 2021 looks strong with nearly $2T stimulus, COVID vaccines, new pres, etc.

Can ARK 2X or 3X your investment in 2021?

I’m able to achieve 2X and more with SPACs and key equity investments, but it’s a lot of work and seems higher risk than ARK... since they actively manage a stronger diversification.

BULL CASE

1. Cathie recently said herself they expect min of 20% growth next few years... I interpret this as, worse case... not likely or best case... I feel she’s trying to downplay their potential so IF they have a bad year she can say she warned everyone that repeating &gt; 200% gains like in 2020 is not guaranteed.
2. ARKS fund can’t go up forever... out flow will eventually damage the funds performance.
3. A market correction is coming.  Ok, but this will hurt most all portfolios and one could argue ARK can better “actively” manage their ETFs through a downturn than most retail and many professional investors.

So... SERIOUS QUESTION... what am I missing?  Why not go all in on ARK ETFs for 2021?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kxnzgg/serious_question_why_not_go_all_in_or_mostly_on/,1.0

But its an interesting thought im considering.  The premise is to keep the number of companies you are holding to a minimum with a smaller account so you can focus on them more in depth and know the company inside and out. And add more companies as your portfolio grows.  

I have money elsewhere but the portfolio in question is currently worth 65k and holds about 44 companies not including the subcompanies of ETFs (ARKK, ARKG Etc.) And BTC.  It grows fast but its volatile and risky.  50% in TSLA, 20% in BTC..  I know a ton about some of these companies.  But I honestly haven't researched the other 40+ stocks.  Mostly its me thinking ""well everyone loves Starbucks they are always packed and will probably be around in 10 years"", here is $500 in SBUX.  So $500 here $1k here $2k there.  I want to make it so I own 6-8 good growth companies that I can research and understand and know the financials and listen to the calls and spend real time with.

What i would like is to have maybe 7 holdings. 10k in 5 of them and 5k in 2 more speculative companies. So 60k reallocated.  This would minimize risk in the companies like Tesla by bringing its percentage down. And minimize risk else where as I would know the companies i am investing in at a much deeper level. 

Anyways I want to know if its a good idea to sell the majority of stock I own and rebalance into the main 7 companies.  Or should I keep my current portfolio as is and add all future money into the core 7, (which will take longer, and wouldn't minimize my current risk but its an option).  

Last caveat is I would have to pay short term cap gains tax next year on everything I sell, which I estimate to be roughly $7-9k

So I dumped my money into WF and turned it into about $15k in a year.  Since about 2011, I have been investing in mainly ETF index funds with the occasional individual stock.  I have a 401K thru work that invests in 2 separate index funds where about half my money is.  Another 25% is in IRAs that I use to actively trade individual stocks and another 25% is in a brokerage account where I had a few ETF (ARKK and VB) and a mutual fund.  Last year all my accounts performed well, especially my IRA due to some lucky trade timing.  My 2020 return was about 30% overall.

After a couple months of unsuccessfully picking stocks on my own, I decided I'd be better off letting ETFs manage the day to day. I'm mostly interested in industries that I believe will see strong growth in the next 3-5 years.  Clean energy, EV, autonomous vehicles. I was heavy in Lidar and had stocks in LAZR, VLDR, and MVIS, but sold LAZR for small profit and currently bagholding on MVIS (not pictured). I don't have a good plan for VLDR and I'm not sure what my exit point will be for it yet.

I'd like to add a marijuana ETF but haven't looked into it enough yet to make a decision.

I don't really understand ARKG or ARKK very well and plan to dump them once they rebound a bit.

Need some advice. I have about 30k of different stocks I am invested in through E-trade. A Roth IRA that I contribute the max to every year. Along with another 14k account that I have invested with mutual funds through Edward's Jones. I have a checking account, but this 14k is for emergency uses and I only pull out of it when contributing to my Roth if I don't want to pull from my checking. Should I instead split the 14k between ARKK ETF's and take out money from them whenever needed? Would this not be smart because of taxing purposes? I don't know. I feel like it could grow better instead of being in mutual funds. Any advice helps. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/krch8e/should_i_put_my_14k_into_arkk_etfs/,1.0
investing,1262396,Why not go all in on ARK and GBTC (Bitcoin Trust)?,kravqf,devilmaskrascal,1609889792,34,1,"I know past performance does not necessarily reflect future performance, but had I bought and held my current portfolio (40% GBTC, 30% ARKK, 10% ARKQ, 10% ARKG, 10% free for picking stocks) one year ago, even assuming the final 10% went to zero, I'd be +130% for the year and now qualifying for long term cap gains rates.

* ARK designs their funds to find the next generation of disruptive stocks, the companies that will dominate in 5-10 years' time, and this year was a year that required significant disruption. All three funds I hold were up 100-190% the past year.) They are actively managed and their holdings fluctuate a lot (meaning replicating their success is not necessarily as simple as just picking their major holdings). I trust them to find the cutting edge companies, but the fact that ARK is picking a company is enough to send the company upwards in many cases because they have such a loyal fan base amongst investors in general.
* Bitcoin is being estimated to be actually worth 5-15x it's current value very soon as widespread acceptance and adoption takes over, and operates as a significant hedge on falling global currencies as well as a potentially overvalued market. GBTC is the most liquid way for investors to jump in and out of Bitcoin. Even though it is not directly equivalent to Bitcoin's value and comes at a premium, it will appreciate in some degree of sync with Bitcoin.

My investment thesis is a lot of people are coming to the same conclusions that I am - that Bitcoin and ARK are again going to outperform the market exponentially in 2021. Cathie Wood and the team at ARK are far better stock pickers than I ever will be, and Bitcoin is now getting 5x current valuations from even places like JP Morgan.

I expect high volatility but I also would bet I don't really need to look at my investments between now and a year from now, and they will still be way better performing than 95% of portfolios and better than the portfolio I could have carefully curated and gambled and stressed about instead.

Any opinions or thoughts on the companies below are appreciated. I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...

Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. 

Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. 

SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations 

Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting patiently. 

Coinbase - expected to report November 5th, seems well positioned from a TA perspective to really take advantage of what is likely to be another rally in the crypto space...

investing,1962371,"""You can't beat the market"", and other faux wisdom I am tired of hearing.",rd0jzd,PmMeClassicMemes,1639111674,54,1,"1) **You can't beat the market**

What does this mean? Is the market SPY? Is the market VTI? Is the market VT? Is the market a 65/35 Equity/Fixed Income Split? Does it mean that you can't have a better sharpe ratio than one of the aforementioned? 

Why do pension funds lend Apple money at a .7% yield? Are they morons? Don't they know that they *can't beat the market*? Why don't they just buy BND? 

The phrase ""You can't beat the market"" is lazy, and meant to imply that essentially any form of active selection of asset classes or assets within classes is doomed to fail. 

Wipe the phrase from your vocabulary. What you are trying to say is that the null hypothesis is that all assets are *priced fairly*. 

Different individuals have different uses for different assets. The relative value of those assets is not identical for all parties. For example - if you work in the oil industry, you should not buy XOM. Why would you just go buy SPY? Do you know how many oil companies are in the SPY? What is the purpose of double-risking your income and your portfolio allocation to them? Are you a *day trader* if you buy industry sector ETFs and leave out oil? Why don't you just *take the market return*? 

Assets are assumed to be priced fairly, and this means they are priced in a risk-neutral fashion. But you should not invest in a risk neutral fashion. If you are 18, you should seek out as much investing leverage as you can reasonably take on and afford to service. If you are 65, you should probably not be leveraged at all. When the 18 year old opens Robinhood and the 65 year old opens Fidelity, they both get to buy and sell the same stocks at the same prices - that doesn't mean that the **VALUE** of the asset is the same for both individuals. 

2) **Just buy VTI bro, excessive Bogleheading, ""Time In The Market"", etc**

You are living in a complete historical anomaly investing in US Markets. This ""wisdom"" is pervasive because this is a primarily English speaking forum. Why don't you look up the stock indexes of Italy or Japan? C'mon bro! Just Buy The Dip! Time In The Market, Bro! Everybody pile into equities, because **it doesn't matter what price you buy at, because in 30 years when you need the money it will be worth more**. 

There are major first world economic powers where their equity indices have performed extremely poorly. If you bought the WW1 Dip in 1916 at the age of 20, when you went to retire at 65 you had a 260% gain. Impressive! Wait. That's a 2.14% CAGR. The DJIA since 1982 is at a 7.34% CAGR. Which one of these returns you got is a fucking dice roll based on what year you were born. You are not guaranteed to win by purchasing equities. 

*Look! He's a bear! This is FUD-posting! Tell us about all your doomsday hypotheses Mr. Bear! I'm going to laugh at your post while buying calls!* 

I don't have any doomsday hypotheses, I can't tell you that this is a historic bubble, it's gonna pop tomorrow because of XYZ. But what I can tell you is that there is a tremendous degree of complacency in this market - it seems the only risk priced in is COVID. And the complacency on every forum I have read my entire life discussing US equities tells me that there is something wrong. Because 

3) **Risk is the source of all return**

This is how assets are priced fairly - yes, someone will make lots of money selling you SPY puts 10% OTM with 1DTE, until one day when they get their ass handed to them. Yes, buying US equities in a balanced stock/bond portfolio, you get a nice 7-8% CAGR since the 1980's. Why is that, exactly? What are companies rewarding you for giving them access to capital for? After all, every time the market goes down, we have the fed put! There is no risk, is there? 

If you put a dollar in a safe, and come back in one year, it will be a dollar. If you put a dollar in the SPY, and come back in one year, sometimes it's 0.85, and sometimes it's 1.30. This scenario also applies to 30 years. If you think it doesn't, you are misinformed about the risks you are taking. If the Fed Put is true, if Daddy will always come bail us out, then the SPY's return should slowly approach the risk free rate - prices should rise until they can't anymore, because the market will slowly grind all the juice out. SPY to 800, because then the earnings yield will approach that of the 10 yr t-bond. 

4) **Active management is bad! Nobody ever beats the Buffet Challenge!**

There are two main reasons that large funds underperform, and neither of them is a good reason for you to be a price insensitive buyer of large cap indices over long time frames without performing any analysis. They are :

A) The goal of someone with a 50m$ net worth is largely principal protection and gaining above the rate of inflation. Yes, there are the insane super rich who hoard returns growing their pile of cash like Smaug, and those who just get off Doing Business and so Do Lots Of Business and try to become mega wealthy. They are not the norm. If I gave you 50m right now, your mindset would not be ""awesome, Im gonna put this in the SPY and turn it into 200m"", it would be ""awesome, I never have to work again and even my grandchildren can be rich if I set this up properly."" Lots of active managers *are not trying to ""beat the market""* in net returns or sharpe ratios or whatever. 

B) Having more money makes you worse at investing, because you move the market against you. You can look at a chart of PLTR and pick out which days Cathie Wood bought, because ARKK is so fucking massive that when she goes ""I want my fund to be .5% more PLTR"", it means she has to figure out how to buy 125 million dollars worth of PLTR. Her orders in the book shift the price. 

Your orders in the book do not shift the price. If you gang up on a stock with everyone else on reddit, they will! But if you go ""I would like to allocate .5% more of my portfolio to PLTR today"", you will not move the market against you. The bid will not jump 1% as you try to fill multiple orders in order to hit your target allocation. There is a peter principle in fund management, where fund managers get given more money by investors until they are ineffectual. 

But don't pretend that can't happen to the SPY just because there's no manager.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rd0jzd/you_cant_beat_the_market_and_other_faux_wisdom_i/,1.0

I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.


To start it off, You are able to check on Morningstar to see all of their 5 star ratings on ETFs which have varying risk return ratios

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

The IRR for ARKK is 21.6% while the IRR for VTI is 25.1%.

Here is the result, value is in million USD:

investing,1899774,Michael Burry just unveiled a new short bet against Cathie's Wood's Arkk innovation ETF,p5zu8c,lib3rty47,1629189760,793,1,"Michael Burry is the latest investor to reveal a bet against the ETF, according to Scion Asset Management's second-quarter 13F filing. Burry initiated the new position by buying $31 million worth of puts in the ARKK ETF.

Burry's not the only one, as the Disruptive Innovation ETF has a 30-day put-to-call ratio of 1.8, meaning more people are buying bearish put options on the fund than bullish call options.

Other investors are outright shorting shares of the ETF, with short interest currently sitting at a record high 11.63%, according to data from Koyfin. With 21.58 million shares sold short as of Friday, the bet against ARK Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF now totals $2.6 billion. 		

Burry's bet against ARK is likely tied to his conviction that Tesla is a short, given that Scion Asset Management's largest position is a $731 million put position in the electric vehicle manufacturer, representing a whopping 35% of his fund's more than $2 billion in assets under management. Burry increased his bet against Tesla by 34% in the second-quarter. 

Tesla remains Ark Invests largest position by a significant margin, with it making up nearly 11% of the ARKK ETF as of Friday. 

The ARKK ETF is down 7% year-to-date, but up 38% over the past year. The ETF was down about 3% on Monday.

They have done a terrific job explaining things layman style and the paper has great visualisation.

Most of these metrics and information could actually be used to value any other coin. An interesting one for me was the realized cap vs. market cap. Realized cap is the average cost basis for the coins that were bought. If the realized cap is above the market cap, it means people have capitulated and are selling at a loss. Current realized cap is well below (\~half)  of the current market cap.

Many other useful metrics out there too!

CryptoCurrency,3641051,Is Grayscale GDLC the best arbitrage play of our lifetime? 20% discount to net assets? or is something odd happening?,qew1uc,ejMileman,1635094341,9,1,"Grayscale funds are only way I have found to buy crypto in my IRAs at traditional brokers like Fidelity, etrade, etc.  I hold some GLDC - see below.  Its a $642million asset fund (but not an etf or mutual fund).  Its more like MSTR without the software company.  Just a bank account and crypto assets.  ARKK held some of its bitcoin fund for a while.  

You can buy and sell GLDC all you want as long as you select ""speculative"" or ""aggressive"" on the investment style at Fidelity or Ameritrade.  Tada. You own crypto in an IRA without doing anything hard or complicated.  Just buy GLDC.

Checking Grayscale website, GLDC is 64% BTC, 26% eth, 4% ADA 3% SOL and the other 3% in other various cryptos that may become something in the future.  It rebalances quarterly.  Nothing strange there.  I like the mix.  BTC is the store of wealth.  ETH is the transactional tool.  And others are incase they overtake.  

Anyway, at times, when ETFs or Mutual funds lack liquidity, they trade slightly above or slightly below net asset value.  Ive never seen a fund trade at more than 1% away from net assets.  I saw this on the website for GLDC for 10/22/2021.  Market price $32.44. NAV of Holdings $40.52.  Isnt that buying dollar bills for 81 cents?  What am I missing on this?  Some valuation info that doesnt' tie out? some FASB rule that requires them to state assets ABOVE NAV?

# TECH IS DEAD, LONG LIVE TECH

So, I dont know how many of you pay attention to the stock market 

If you do, you'd know that speculative stocks have taken an absolute thrashing since mid February. We're talking 60%-80%+ down on some of these companies, particularly anything related to tech, electric vehicles, green energy, or avant-garde growth.

Cue the wailing and gnashing of teeth. Tech is dead forever, ARKK will never recover, buy banks, utilities and oil companies, etc etc.

There could be many different reasons for this extreme sell off in the more speculative sectors, but a lot has to do with simple sector rotation: meaning institutions &amp; fund managers will lock in profits by selling high flying stocks that have flown a liiiiiiiiiiiitle too close to the sun. They then put that money into lagging sectors like banks &amp; energy (who everyone proclaimed were dead forever 6 months ago, btw). These happen to perform better under higher inflation, so it made for a great narrative

I'm surprised that bitcoin, which I consider a speculative asset, held up so well for that extra month or two, hitting ATH in April. Like SPACs &amp; green energy, it went on a crazy run and needed to cool off.

So, the **Great Sell™** finally came for us, too. Now that institutions are more &amp; more involved in bitcoin (and crypto in general), they are/were probably locking in those gains and shifting the money elsewhere

&amp;#x200B;

# Does this mean crypto is dead forever? Is there going to be another 3 year bear market? Will China ban crypto for the 7th time next year?

Who knows! nothing is certain

Growth stocks &amp; tech are showing some signs of life lately, ironically at the point when reddit is the most bearish on them (as always -- euphoria at the top, pessimism at the bottom). Some of those crypto profits may have even went into shares of those companies. Heck, even GameStop and AMC are popping off again

My advice during major volatility is to ignore short term price action and focus on the fundamentals

With stocks, that's easy. The #1 factor over the long run for a company's stock price going up and to the right is earnings growth. You may get huge swings up and down on the chart -- even Amazon had multiple 50%+ crashes over the years! --  but as long as the company is making more &amp; more money every year, the stock price will catch up and reflect that

With crypto, it's trickier as there's no revenue or profits to speak of. So, you have to focus on things like technology &amp; adoption. For me personally, it's hard to be bearish on the crypto space as a whole when I see such cool things happening behind the scenes in my favorite projects. In general, I know that institutions are buying in, banks are creating funds for private clients, and now even entire countries are warming up to it

This post is getting longer than I intended and I know most of you cant read anyway. So I'll wrap it up with a

# tldr;

1.  don't freak out about short term volatility. keep your calm, focus on the tech &amp; what's happening in the space, not the price (unless you are a trader)
2. money will move in &amp; out of sectors when it gets too hot, but it always comes back so long as the fundamental value is there (see #1). crypto is no exception. it went on a crazy run. big money will let it cool off before buying back in for cheap once retail investors are bored
3. dont gamble money you cant afford to lose. dont bet it all on one horse. otherwise you will make bad emotional decisions. i know ppl who panic sold FaceBook after the IPO when it crashed down to \~$15 / share.  also, i know a guy who went all in on 3DFX instead of Nvidia in the 90s. he was CERTAIN video games and graphic processors would be huge, but thought 3DFX had way better tech &amp; mass appeal (they did, at the time). he was 100% correct. it didnt matter though, his pick went bankrupt. if he had chosen Nvidia instead, he'd be a multi-multi millionaire
4. to go along with #3, being invested in multiple different things means you dont freak out if one asset class, stock or crypto token goes through a rough sell off. some call this the Sleep Well at Night investment strategy
5. instead of buying ONLY the coins themselves, i recommend also dabbling in stocks that deal with crypto like the exchanges or banks. Coinbase is a recently listed, high profile example. Kraken will probably list sometime soon. eToro is undergoing a reverse merger via SPAC. There aren't too many crypto pure-plays yet, but I expect the list to grow quick. Keep an eye out. Watch this space. This lets you be agnostic on any specific coin

GL and remember **nobody here has a crystal ball**

if someone claims that BTC is going to $5,000 or $500,000, ask to borrow theirs so you can be fabulously rich too
